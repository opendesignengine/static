Like all buses, this one needs a destination in order to know when to call the project done.  I recommend a functional approach where a repeatable result is the goal.  For a ground station, I would think that this goal should be the ability to perform one or more of the following actions for minimum effort and expense:
	<ol>
	<li> Contact a satellite for confirmation.  A pingback where we confirm the contact.</li>
		<li> Contact another ham radio operator through the satellite, using it as a repeater.</li>
		<li> Contact ISS through the station's ham radio receiver.</li>
	</ol>

	<ul>
	<li>Hardware, may be a PC, Laptop, or embedded PC like a Raspberry Pi.</li>
		<li>Prediction and plotting software, I like gpredict, but there are plenty of others.</li>
		<li>Optionally the ability to automatically operate the other two systems.  This can be accomplished with hamlib which interfaces with gpredict.</li>

	<p>2.  Radio System (the receiver and transmitter are usually part of the same radio equipment.  This is a "Dual band" transceiver).</p>


<blockquote>

	<ul>
	<li>Receiver in the VHF ham range (example OSCAR-52 can be monitored at 145.9250-145.8750 MHz).  Reception of signals may be done without a license.</li>
		<li>Transmitter in the UHF ham range (example OSCAR-52 can be contacted at 435.2250-435.2750 MHz).  This requires a radio operator's license.</li>
		<li>A licensed radio operator.  I include this in the radio system because without them, the set may legally only be used to receive.</li>
	</ul>


</blockquote>

	<p>3.  Antenna system</p>


<blockquote>

	<ul>
	<li>A high gain omnidirectional antenna set up for the expected frequency and polarization such as the "eggbeater" and "turnstile" designs.</li>
		<li>Optionally a high gain Yagi array or dish which are directional and must be pointed.</li>
		<li>Optionally a way to point the directional antenna at the satellite using azimuth and elevation data.</li>

	<p>For the computer system, a level one kite has little cost unless we want to run gpredict on a raspberry pi (which is both cool and possible).  The trouble is that is is not really all that practical, with the CPU nailing 100% utilization when running with hamlib and serial port emulation to tie it into a radio and azimuth-elevation mount.  It would be better to run the system on an existing laptop or PC.  A possible level one kite could be predicting an ISS pass and watching for the reflection from the solar panels.</p>

<h3 >Radio System<a href="287.html#Radio-System" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>A level one kite for the radio system of this project may be a challenge. Radios which are capable of doing the job and are able to be controlled by the computer system to automatically compensate for doppler shift cost about $200-300 to start and go WAY up from there. The way I'm going to recommend getting around the problem with the cost of the radio is this:  Just as we assume a person has a computer to talk to Arduino for Shepherd, it should be a safe bet that anyone who attempts this project has both a computer, is a licensed amateur radio operator, and owns a dual band (VHF/UHF) radio.  I recommend therefore that a level one kite for the radio system should be the receipt of a technician class ham radio license.</p>

<h3 >Antenna System<a href="287.html#Antenna-System" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>The antenna design for a level one kite has already been done for us, and the designs for the antenna are free to use, available at <a class="external" href="http://on6wg.pagesperso-orange.fr/Page%201.html">http://on6wg.pagesperso-orange.fr/Page%201.html</a>.  I think we can do a better job on the instructions though, an perhaps our focus for the level one kite should be refining the design, a construction guide, and usage instructions.  This is another thing we can "kitify".While omnidirectional antennas like these lack a certain level of appeal the movement of a tracking high gain rig has, as well as some of the gain, we can save that for another kite.</p>


	<p>With the computer running gpredict, connected to the radio and the completed antenna, the licensed user can accomplish the actions outlined in the project scope.</p></div>

	<p>Most ham operators are closet space nuts.  It is possible to get a better price, particularly at a ham fest or from a private seller, if the seller is informed of who we are, what we represent, and what we plan to do with the equipment.  There is also a good chance that a licensed operator will come with the equipment.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Very close.  The antennas require no control input from the computer running hamlib, only the positioning drive does to point the high gain.  Another change I made to the diagram was to clarify that the operator controls both the transmitter and receiver, though this may be a moot point since they tend to be combined into one unit.  Another minor difference is that there are usually different antennas for the UHF and VHF sides, even if you only see the one device, so I made the word antenna plural.</p>


	<p>I will have information on antenna rotators, directional arrays and omnidirectional designs shortly.</p>


	<p>Have a look at <a class="external" href="http://www.ve3sqb.com/hamaerials/oz2oe/">http://www.ve3sqb.com/hamaerials/oz2oe/</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/information/faqs/crow/">http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/information/faqs/crow/</a>.  The larger antenna is VHF.  An easy way to remember is that as frequency goes down, the parts get bigger.</p></div>

	<p>The antennas don't have any auto-tuning functionality attached to them that might be controlled by a computer? I'm a little out of the loop on all of this. I really need to get at least a technician class Ham license.</p>


	<p>Would it be more appropriate to show that the VHF receiver and the UHF transmitter may be grouped, or does that just clutter the diagram up and make it less clear? Notice the dashed box around the receiver and transmitter.</p>

	<p>Autotuners are usually not controlled, but rather automagically find the matching impedance by hunting for the lowest dissipation across the circuit.  They generally are self contained and placed in line between the transmitter and antenna.  The gotcha is that just like a series resistor, the addition of a tuner (automatic or manual) will drop the power applied to the antenna depending on how mismatched the antenna is to the radio.  The difficulty compounds in higher frequencies to the point that autotuners are rare in VHF and just about unheard of in UHF.  Experience has shown most hams that they are better off replacing a mismatched component than trying to match it.</p>


	<p>I think we have our block diagram.  We can add other bells ans whistles later.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>What do you think for the next step? I'm thinking maybe a roadmap of the level one kites you've outlined with a timeline, and metrics on each component of the roadmap for current completeness and whether it's open vs closed source/hardware. In my mind the timeline would only show the relative number of days/months to have each component completed, not when during the year they would be ready. Once we have that roadmap, I'm thinking the architecture study item that we have on the Mach 30 strategic planning outline would be complete, or at least ready for review to see whether it was complete or not.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I think we still need some data on antenna systems, both omnidirectional and directional, as well as a small, lightweight antenna rotator.  The rotator will be a much more interesting project since none of the hobby designs are quite up to the task, and the commercial offerings are expensive and primitive.  Once this documentation is in place, we can start on the level one kites for the antenna subsystem.</p>


	<p>There are several antenna projects I see as level one kites:<br />1. Construction of an omnidirectional antenna (turnstile or eggbeater designs)<br />2. Construction of a yagi directional antenna<br />3. Lightweight antenna rotator using a microcontroller, stepper motors, 3D printed planetary gear train, and enclosure/mount.</p>


	<p>Once the level one kites are somewhat solidified, let's come up with a roadmap.  It should be noted that a minimum ground station will consist of at least five kites, making the cost around $1000 to go from nothing to functional when everything is said and done.</p>


	<p>At this point, I would say the planning is complete, and we can submit it for review.  If approved, I would like to create separate sub-projects for each level one kite (most are already in place in ODE) so that development can go parallel.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Guys, this is some great work.  I am especially excited to see the block diagram coming together.  I think we are off to a great start, but in reviewing this, I realized we skipped the questions from <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/boards/4/topics/8?r=34#message-34" class="external">Amanda Wozniak's process</a> (though the conversation has been leaning towards several of them).  If you all will indulge me for a few more posts, I would like to run through them and make sure we have covered everything we need to in the requirements phase.</p>


	<p>I will post my best summaries/approximations of answers to the questions and we can then discuss them.</p>


	<p><strong>Q1. Why are we making this?</strong></p>


	<p>Tracking, communication, and command &#38; control of spacecraft are essential capabilities for a spacefaring civilization.  Ground stations are the principle links between the spacecraft and Earth used to facilitate these capabilities.  The series of ground station related projects will develop the necessary open source hardware to perform these functions.</p>


	<p><strong>Q2. Who is this for?</strong></p>


	<p>Mach 30 volunteers, Makerspaces and their members, CubeSat designers and operators (including universities).</p>


	<p><strong>Q3. How will this be used?</strong></p>


	<p>Early ground stations will be used to facilitate voice communications with orbiting satellites (including the ISS, HAM satellites, and CubeSats).  Note, not all satellites will support voice communications, in which case the early ground stations will simply provide a means of listening to the satellites' other radio signals.</p>


	<p><strong>Q4. What features does it need to have (now)?</strong></p>


	<p>Ability to predict opportunities for contact, and the ability to receive and send voice traffic.</p>


	<p><strong>Q5. What features does it need to have (later)?</strong></p>


	<p>In the future, our ground stations should be able to support sending and receiving command and control data from orbiting spacecraft.  Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the possibility of linking multiple ground stations together to provide larger coverage area (imagine if makerspaces across the country, or world, had ground stations linked over the internet so smaller satellite operators could have greater coverage and contact to their satellites).</p>


	<p><strong>Q6. What are the legacy requirements?</strong></p>


	<p>Transmitting will require HAM radio licenses (technician level or greater).</p>


	<p><strong>Q7. Who's going to build this?</strong></p>


	<p>This is a point of discussion, since the current 2013 Mach 30 Annual Plan does nto yet have hardware expenses budgeted for this project.</p>


	<p><strong>Q8. How many do we want to make?</strong></p>


	<p>This is a great opportunity to develop a kit which individuals, makerspaces, universities, etc could build and set up.</p>


	<p><strong>Q9. What is the budget?</strong></p>


	<p>Individual level 1 kites have a budget of approximately $200.  However, this project will clearly have multiple kites, so the over all budget will go much higher.  Current estimates are about 5 kites or about $1000.</p>


	<p><strong>Q10. What is the timeline?</strong></p>


	<p>TBD - again the current 2013 Mach 30 Annual Plan did not budget for this to go into production so quickly (we did not anticipate increased levels of participation coming so quickly)</p>


	<p><strong>Q11. What waste products will be produced by the manufacture and/or operation of this?</strong></p>


	<p>TBD - are there any elements that cannot be reused in later kites that would need intermediate disposal?  Would any of the prototypes be kept as museum pieces?</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I had not heard of Wozniak's process, but it fits the way I evaluate projects, which is probably why the questions were pretty much already answered.</p>


	<p>Here are my thoughts on each point:</p>


	<p><strong>Q1. Why are we making this?</strong></p>


	<p>Tracking, communication, and command &#38; control of spacecraft are essential capabilities for a spacefaring civilization. Ground stations are the principle links between the spacecraft and Earth used to facilitate these capabilities. The series of ground station related projects will develop the necessary open source hardware to perform these functions.</p>


	<p>Spot on, though for C&#38;C you are going to need a tracking system since those channels tend to be in a higher frequency range and thus will need a dish  This capability would probably be a level 2 kite.</p>


	<p><strong>Q2. Who is this for?</strong></p>


	<p>Mach 30 volunteers, Makerspaces and their members, CubeSat designers and operators (including universities).</p>


	<p>With some minor modifications, most of them software, we can add radio astronomy to the mix.</p>


	<p><strong>Q3. How will this be used?</strong></p>


	<p>Early ground stations will be used to facilitate voice communications with orbiting satellites (including the ISS, HAM satellites, and CubeSats). Note, not all satellites will support voice communications, in which case the early ground stations will simply provide a means of listening to the satellites' other radio signals.</p>


	<p>Data capabilities can be added easily to the system, either by demodulating the audio stream (think computer modem), or by using an Software Defined Receiver (SDR) such as the AMSAT Funcube Dongle or USRP and running the demodulation through a software module (GNU radio) using a PC or Laptop.</p>


	<p><strong>Q4. What features does it need to have (now)?</strong></p>


	<p>Ability to predict opportunities for contact, and the ability to receive and send voice traffic.</p>


	<p>Precisely.  This means that the directional antennas and antenna rotator should both be reserved for Version 2.0, which would keep the costs to a minimum.</p>


	<p><strong>Q5. What features does it need to have (later)?</strong></p>


	<p>In the future, our ground stations should be able to support sending and receiving command and control data from orbiting spacecraft. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the possibility of linking multiple ground stations together to provide larger coverage area (imagine if makerspaces across the country, or world, had ground stations linked over the internet so smaller satellite operators could have greater coverage and contact to their satellites).</p>


	<p>Linking would require standardized equipment with the audio stream being synched by a precision GPS timebase.  This will probably be necessary for radio science and video applications as well.  For something similar in many ways, have a look at <a class="external" href="http://www.irlp.net/">http://www.irlp.net/</a></p>


	<p><strong>Q6. What are the legacy requirements?</strong></p>


	<p>Transmitting will require HAM radio licenses (technician level or greater).</p>


	<p>Different countries may have other requirements.</p>


	<p><strong>Q7. Who's going to build this?</strong></p>


	<p>This is a point of discussion, since the current 2013 Mach 30 Annual Plan does not yet have hardware expenses budgeted for this project.</p>


	<p>I will be building myself one at the very least.</p>


	<p><strong>Q8. How many do we want to make?</strong></p>


	<p>This is a great opportunity to develop a kit which individuals, makerspaces, universities, etc could build and set up.</p>


	<p>We can kitify the omni antenna, for the current project and the yagi antennas and rotator for Version 2.0</p>


	<p><strong>Q9. What is the budget?</strong></p>


	<p>Individual level 1 kites have a budget of approximately $200. However, this project will clearly have multiple kites, so the over all budget will go much higher. Current estimates are about 5 kites or about $1000.</p>


	<p>...if you add the radio(s) and extra toys that price can go WAAAAY up.  We need to keep the Version 1.0 ground station as simple as possible and still operable.  I was even thinking about removing the integration with the software.  We'd loose doppler compensation (manual works), but it would allow the use of dual band radios not on the list.  These tend to be simpler and cheaper, with some available for under $100.  The gotcha is that these radios cannot be controlled by the software, so the upgrade path is then blocked.  Thoughts?</p>


	<p><strong>Q10. What is the timeline?</strong></p>


	<p>TBD - again the current 2013 Mach 30 Annual Plan did not budget for this to go into production so quickly (we did not anticipate increased levels of participation coming so quickly)</p>


	<p>My timeline for the unit I intend to build and use is within 2013 and in time to do so outdoors.</p>


	<p><strong>Q11. What waste products will be produced by the manufacture and/or operation of this?</strong></p>


	<p>TBD - are there any elements that cannot be reused in later kites that would need intermediate disposal? Would any of the prototypes be kept as museum pieces?</p>


	<p>Hmmm.  If you upgrade to directional antennas, you don't need the omnis, though they would still be a fine backup.  If a cheap (not on the supported list) radio is used, it would eliminate the ability to later perform doppler compensation, and this would prevent data and telemetry work.  Parts were chosen to give the user a clear upgrade path with a minimum of orphans on the way.</p></div>

	<p>The attached spreadsheet lists all omnidirectional circularly polarized radio antennas that can be constructed in the average home workshop.  <br />Scoring is fairly straightforward, with points assigned for each dB of gain, for the ability to pick up a signal from zenith, and for simplicity of construction.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>1. I agree. It would be great to have Greg's input too.<br />2. I think I feel most comfortable with the engineering process when we work things out in the forum and then hold a Hangout as we are doing here. Doing the bulk in the forum gives everyone a chance to participate when they have the opportunity, and gives people a chance to think about things for a day or so to see if any other ideas come to mind. I agree though that the final push to finalize things like this tends to go better in a Hangout.<br />3. It's a nice setup because I think we've got steps 1 (Initial Questions) and 3 (Block Diagram) of the Mach 30 SEP pretty much done, and step 1 should lead to step 2 (Requirements) without too much trouble. Not to mention the roadmap and other information.</p>


	<p>I know this is a tough question to ask until we get the Export Controls Taskforce spun up, but how far can we take this project before we get into export controls land?</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I've set the wiki up for this project, and have tried to combine the initial questions into a document <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/gs-001/wiki/Initial_Questions" class="external">here</a></p>


	<p>Comments or corrections are welcomed.</p>


	<p>There was a question asked in Aaron's initial questions above about whether to add the radios into the level 1 kites. My thoughts are that while not ideal, for a level 1 ($200) kite we should stick with the dual band radios that are simpler and less than $100. The goal is to get an entry level system, and the lack of software interface will just have to be something that's rectified in a later version. I would think that would also make the level 1 kite a better place to start for people new to satellite tracking (like myself). If I learn to do things manually with a lower-end dual band radio, the software radio control is not such a black box later on when the computer's handling things for me. That should also put someone in a better position to troubleshoot problems when the software radio control isn't doing its job properly.</p>


	<p>Thoughts? Agree, disagree?</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Couldn't agree more with the idea that one should learn a process manually before letting automation take over.  It really clarifies what is going on in the automated system.  My only concern is setting people up to purchase multiple radios...  It is not a "blocking" level concern, I would just like to chat about it a little more to make sure I feel like we have done due diligence with regards to stepping up between levels of capability.</p>


	<p>I should go look at the radio chart again and get my bearings on cost vs capability since I think my concern would be far less of an issue if the intro radios were low enough cost...</p>


	<p>Will post more after I look at radios...</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>We've filled in steps 1 and 3 of the Mach 30 SEP, so we've got the initial questions and block diagram. Do we have enough information to fill in the requirements document as well? That's SEP step <a href="http://opendesignengine.net/issues/2" class="issue status-3 priority-2 closed" title="Install available Bot filters (Resolved)">#2</a>. I thought maybe we should look at filling that out before completing the architecture study doc, which is a new addition to the SEP for this project.</p></div>
