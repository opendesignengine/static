<h2>Getting ready for the OHS</h2>

<div class="message">
<p><span class="author">Added by <a href="../../../users/3.html" class="icon icon-contributor-license">J. Simmons</a> <a href="../../../projects/shepard-ts/activity%3Ffrom=2012-09-04.html" title="09/04/2012 11:11 pm">about 10 years</a> ago</span></p>
<div class="wiki">
<p>We will be demo'ing Shepard at the <a href="http://summit.oshwa.org/" class="external">Open Hardware Summit</a> on Sept 27.  I want to use this thread to organize our work for the demo table.  We need to work on the following items to get ready:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The poster - see info below for details</li>
		<li>Fliers/Handouts - what info do we want to have on handouts about Shepard, Mach 30, etc</li>
		<li>Video of Shepard tests (and assembly photos, etc) - we cannot do live demos so we need a video of operations to show off the coolness</li>
		<li>Ship Test Stand to NYC - need to check with OHS to see if we can ship it directly to EyeBeam and we need to set a drop dead ship date for it to arrive by 9/26</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Let me know if I am forgetting anything.  Just as a reminder, here is the text of our submission of the demo.</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>Description:<br />This demonstration is intended to share Mach 30’s progress in open source spaceflight and to encourage attendees to get involved by building their own test stands at their local hackerspaces.</p>


	<p>The Shepard Test Stand (<a class="external" href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts">https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts</a>) is an open source test stand for Estes rocket motors. This project is the first in a series of open source projects to develop the required skills for the practice of safe rocket engine operation, and to develop the capability to measure and record data about a rocket engine's performance. The use of Estes class motors provides a relatively safe environment to learn in before moving to higher powered motors and engines. The ultimate goal is to develop test stands for full scale liquid rocket engines for use in orbital launch systems.</p>


	<p>The demonstration will cover the design and operation of the Shepard Test Stand.  Visitors will be shown the components of the test stand and their function in rocket testing for both large and small rockets.  Afterward, visitors will be walked through the rocket motor test process.  If outdoor space can be provided the demonstration will include a live motor test, otherwise videos of previous tests will be shown.  Upon completion of the test (or test videos) visitors will be shown how to interpret the results of a rocket motor test.  The demonstration will conclude with how visitors can build their own test stand and get involved in future development.</p>


</blockquote>

	<p>Info from OHS about the demo table and poster:</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>Demo<br />You’ll have half a table for your demo and one outlet. Please bring your own power strip if you need to plug in more than one device. Keep in mind this is an informal project demo, and complex requirements/constraints (light/sound conditions, etc.) will be difficult to accommodate.</p>


	<p>Poster<br />This year we’re requiring demo presenters to also bring a (printed) poster, which will function as signage, information about the project, and documentation for posterity. Here’s an example of a good poster: <a class="external" href="http://smus.com/chi-2010-poster/ubiquitous-drums-poster.jpg">http://smus.com/chi-2010-poster/ubiquitous-drums-poster.jpg</a>. You have a lot of creative latitude, but when designing your poster try to think of what you’d want people to know about your project if you were unable to talk to them in person.</p>


	<p>Recommended poster size for demo presenters is A1 (or 24 × 36 inches) portrait. Please let us know if, for any reason, this format doesn’t work for you.</p>


	<p>Digital poster files will be published on the OHS website after the event.</p>


	<p>If you have any questions about posters or would like to know more about this type presentation, please email our Poster Chair, Paulo Blikstein at summit-posters (at) oshwa (dot) org. Paulo has extensive experience with this format and will be able to give you good advice.</p>


	<p>Please send your digital poster file to Paulo by August 31st, but remember that you will have to print it and bring it to the summit yourself.</p>


</blockquote>

	<p><strong>Example poster mentioned above</strong></p>


	<p><img src="http://smus.com/chi-2010-poster/ubiquitous-drums-poster.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Further instructions about the demo from the OHS coordinators:</p>


<blockquote>

	<p>1) We extended the deadline to send your poster to us for a final review to Sept 10th -- Paulo Blikstein, our Posters Chair, needs to receive a pdf or jpg of your poster asap to give you some quick feedback and add your poster to our website. When emailing, please try to keep file size below 2MB. Remember that poster dimensions are A1 or American equivalent (24 x 36 inches - portrait) for posters accompanying demos.</p>


	<p>2) Remember that you should bring your printed poster and working demos to Eyebeam the day before the summit. Setup time is <strong>September 26, from 10 am to 6 pm</strong> at Eyebeam. Needless to say, all kinds of things go wrong when you have to demo, so make sure you have ample time to assemble and test things and that you bring everything you need. We'll have a power outlet available and table space.</p>


	<p>3) Here's some advice from Paulo:</p>


	<p>Even though you might be a veteran in demoing your work, keep in mind that posters are slightly different. Your poster should have two goals:<br />a) A quick summary of your project for people who don't want (or don't have time to) talk to you. In this scenario, people might walk by your poster, stop for a few seconds, and move on. So you want communicate your "take home" message quickly, in a sentence (or image) or two. The best way to do it is to design your poster in a way that that message is clearly highlighted -- using little text, lots of cool graphics/images, and a large font.<br />b) A conversation starter for people who might want to get more information. Some people will talk to you and try to go deeper into your work -- for that scenario, you want your poster to support the conversation, so imagine that you will be talking to attendees and pointing to things on your poster. For that purpose, make sure you have pictures, schemes, diagrams, and summaries of your conclusions that will guide that conversation. Also, a good thing to do is to rehearse a 1-minute summary of your poster -- when people are walking around a poster session, they want to see as many things as possible, so keeping them for too long is not a good strategy.</p>


	<p>Two other important points:<br />- Make sure the "follow up" information is easy to find: websites, QR codes, business cards, postcards, handouts. Remember that people will see tens of posters and demos and sometimes the only way to remember your work will be a handout (in any format). Make sure people know what is the next action in order to know more about your work -- email you? Go to the website? Buy the product?<br />- Keep in mind that many people will try to remember your work by taking pictures with their smartphones, so make sure your poster is "picture-friendly"  as well.</p>


	<p>4) Again, here's an example of a good poster: <a class="external" href="http://smus.com/chi-2010-poster/ubiquitous-drums-poster.jpg">http://smus.com/chi-2010-poster/ubiquitous-drums-poster.jpg</a></p>


	<p>5) Digital poster files will be published on the OHS website after the event.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Just did some research about shipping costs.  Assuming we can pack it in a box close to the dimensions of Shepard and we include no more than 5 lbs of additional material in the box for use in the demo (things like power bar, stickers to give away, etc) then the cost would be $17.60 each way, and we could ship it as late as 9/21 and have it arrive by 9/25.  I recommend we aim to ship it on 9/20.</p>


	<p>I will check with the OHS folks to see if there is any problem shipping Shepard directly to the summit location.</p></div>
