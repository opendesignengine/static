<div class="wiki">
<p>I've pulled out the current structure related <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Requirements_document" class="external">requirements</a> for review below. After these are set we'll make another pass for the software requirements. Ideally, I'd like to have some discussion here so that we're well prepared to wrap these requirements up at the next Shepard focused Hangout.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Here are my thoughts (based on reviewing our revisions to the <a href="../../../projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Initial_Questions.html" class="wiki-page">Initial Questions</a>.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 1.2</strong> The STS must be <del>mobile enough to enable live demonstrations as part of educational and outreach activities</del> compact and light weight enough to accommodate shipping to conferences and other demonstration events or transporting up to ten copies in the same passenger car.
	<ul>
	<li> <strong>STSR 1.2.1</strong> The STS total weight (structure and DAQ) shall be less than <del>25</del> 5.0 pounds (<del>11.3</del> 2.7 Kg). <del>, or be able to break into components that weigh no more than 25 pounds (11.3 Kg) each (based on OSHA recommendations).</del> <- <em>guessing at a revised weight, need to check Aaron's prototype weight to see if this is realistic</em></li>
		<li><strong>STSR 1.2.3</strong> The STS structure shall be no larger than <em>&lt;insert reasonable dimensions to support low cost shipping here&gt;</em></li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Strike <strong>STSR 4</strong> or move the <strong>STSR 1.2.x</strong> requirements to <strong>STSR 4.x</strong></li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 4.6.4</strong> The temperature sensor will have two mounting options: a) mounting for measurement of the case temperature as specified above, b) mounting for measuring the flame temperature</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 4.10</strong> The motor mount must be able to survive catastrophic motor failure (eg motors exploding during a test)
	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 4.10.1</strong> The motor mount must not create metal or plastic shrapnel when exposed to an exploding motor during test</li>
		<li><strong>STSR 4.10.2</strong> The motor mount must be repairable within 60 minutes after a motor explosion and repairs must cost less than $10 (US)</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 4.11</strong> The STS structure will include space to display identifying marks (eg Mach 30 logo, STS logo, OSHW logo, etc) and safety information (eg warnings, safety instructions, etc)</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 8.1</strong> The design of the STS must enable the <del>completion of at least one operational test stand</del> sale of dozens to hundreds of kits per year (and possibly more as demand warrants).</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Strike <strong>STSR 8.2</strong></li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 9.1</strong> The cost of the materials for the STS (not including consumables or user purchased computational equipment) must not exceed $80. <- <em>the "computational equipment" is a backdoor to allow us to offload the price of the Arduino Uno from the kit price by making it a separate purchase like the PC.</em></li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 10.1</strong> The v2.0 prototype of the STS should be completed and undergo initial test firing no later than Dec 31, 2013.</li>
	</ul>


<hr />


	<p>OK, so I have not captured what it means to be "hackable" and I may have missed something else, but hopefully this gets the ball rolling.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>A couple things have come up as I've been working on this.</p>


	<p>1. Our requirement statements usually only cover the "what", not the "why" or the "who". Should those aspects be included in the statements, or is that non-standard for a requirements document?<br />2. I think that J is touching on this in the comment to strike STSR 4 or move STSR 1.2.x, but I think that we've had some of our requirements placed under technical requirements that should be project requirements, and vice versa. Also, some requirements seem to be mapped to the wrong initial questions and our technical requirements don't always seem to have measurable (quantifiable) outcomes to them.</p>


	<p>Below is an attempt I made on reorganization and the creation of templates to include the why, what, and who aspects. It only covers initial questions 1 through 3 and part of 4. Before I put any more time into it I want to see if I'm headed in the wrong direction.</p>


	<p>As a reminder, technical requirements have measurable outcomes attached to them, and project requirements do not.</p>

	<li><strong>STSR 1.x</strong> The STS should [task/focus] so that [organization/individual] can [goal/accomplishment].</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Example taken from the initial question:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 1.1</strong> The STS should focus on low power, commercially available amateur rocket motors so that Mach 30 and partner organizations can provide a safe first experience for both designers and operators.</li>
	</ul>

	<li><strong>STSR 1.2</strong> The STS should provide a platform for performing live demonstrations so that Mach 30 and its educational partners can conduct educational and outreach activities.</li>

	</ul>


	<p>Example taken from the initial question.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>STSR 2.1</strong> The STS should provide a middle school (6th through 8th grade in the U.S.) teacher who does not have the support of an IT department, and who does not have computer expertise beyond how to connect a USB cable and install software, with the ability to introduce their students to rocket science in a safe and hands-on way.</li>
		<li><strong>STSR 2.2</strong> The STS should provide open source spaceflight designers with the ability to learn about measuring the performance of rocket motors in a low risk way so that they can progress to larger motors and engines safely.</li>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Jeremy,</p>


	<p>When I was working on my previous post, I started pondering some of the same questions you brought up.  On reflection, I am starting to think the Initial Questions actually break down into three categories.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Project Background Questions - questions which help set the stage for the questions which turn into technical and project requirements.  They are also good places to look for narrative which can be used in promotional material for the project.  This would cover questions 1, 2, 3, &#38; 7.</li>
		<li>Technical Requirement Questions - questions which when answered lead to technical requirements (those that can be measured and deal with the performance of the hardware being developed).  This covers questions 4, 5 (after a fashion, but I almost think this should become a question 4b with what we call question 4 being question 4a), &#38; 6.</li>
		<li>Project Requirement Questions - questions which when answered lead to project requirements (requirements are the remaining requirements which are not tied to specific performance values).  This would cover questions 8, 9, 10, &#38; 11.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Assuming something like this structure made sense to other people, I would want to discuss reorganizing the Initial Questions (including renumbering them) to look something like this:</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Jeremy,</p>


	<p>I am just now getting around to looking at your comment (attending conferences always makes it hard to keep up with communications).   Requirements, as a rule of thumb, are inherently answer the whats of a project ("what must it do?  what must it measure?  what must it accept?  what must it produce?).  The who and why type questions are really about a different aspect of the project.  And having captured the who and why in the initial questions, I don't think we need to capture them anywhere else.</p>


	<p>As for why then do we have requirements to recapture the what type questions...  We do this for requirements so we can add the next level of detail to the what type questions by including measurable performance specifications (preferably with both thresholds, minimum acceptable performance, and objectives, highly desired performance).  Also, by capturing these measurable aspects of the hardware or management of the project in one place, we can more easily reference them when reviewing a project for completeness.</p>


	<p>Hope that helps.</p>


	<p>In terms of the template sentences, I think I missed your examples (this thread is getting pretty dense with all the formatting I threw in around the new layout of the questions and requirements docs).  Can you comment on just that part below?</p></div>
