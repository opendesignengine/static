  <div class="wiki"><p>Not really sure where to put this idea since it seems like it's more of a payload, but TT&#38;C will do.</p>


	<p>One of the biggest questions about rockets is what do you do with the thing? What's the value proposition? One thing people are always looking for is content, and a camera mounted on a rocket would make great content. As things like 4K video and VR video emerge in the next few years we could be ready with a system for mounting HD 360 cameras on rockets and streaming the whole picture back for enjoyment in real time and recording for later.<br />A camera like this <a class="external" href="http://www.cnet.com/news/kogeto-comes-full-circle-with-joey-seamless-360-degree-4k-video-camera/">http://www.cnet.com/news/kogeto-comes-full-circle-with-joey-seamless-360-degree-4k-video-camera/</a><br />Viewed through a VR headset like this <a class="external" href="http://www.oculus.com/">http://www.oculus.com/</a><br />Would allow the viewer to "sit" on top of a rocket as it launches and look anywhere they please. It could contribute funding to the rocket launching organization. They could charge a premium to stream it live during the launch, and charge a nominal fee to download the VR-ready file afterwards.</p>


	<p>We would build the system that has a sturdy camera, image processing/caching, and transmitting/receiving. Since that would probably be beefier than the normal TT&#38;C system it could just take over and perform normal TT&#38;C duties in addition to the "payload" duties.</p>


	<p>Engineering expertise - (1) I haven't heard anyone in M30 talking about having done stuff like this. A couple people have experience that would probably translate. <br />Fabrication - (4) It probably wouldn't be nearly as hard to build as to design and debug. We'd probably buy an off-the-shelf camera, and the electronics might also mostly come OTS. Then we just need an enclosure.<br />Mission - (4) Everything about it could be published, although it would probably be harder to build it without any proprietary blobs. The content would also be particularly useful for educational outreach. Who wouldn't want to have their students "ride" a launching rocket?<br />Income - (5) I'm picturing this as done primarily for the income potential. It's an engaging enough idea we could probably crowdfund it once we had a prototype. Then afterwards we could sell the system itself and the VR-ready files it records.<br />Admin - (3) I haven't seen anything in ITAR that has a problem with video recording. There is a slight possibility that someone might object that this isn't really a TT&#38;C system and it's really a payload, but since it's an integral part of the rocket I don't think that would be a problem. We could ramp up by starting with a system small enough to ride on model-sized rockets, prove the feasibility, then make one for high-powered rockets. It would be a nice way to side-step into the NAR-run world because we wouldn't even be building rocket parts per se, just something that helps the guys already building rockets enjoy them even more. That being said, the recording, streaming, and display technologies involved come with an inherent minimum cost and it also leverages the assumption that people are going to be looking for VR-style content in a year or two; both assumptions might tank the project if we're unlucky.</p></div>
