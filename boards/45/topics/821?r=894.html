<p>Please comment below on the 5 requirements from <a href="815.html" class="message">Choosing the technology branch for the v 1.0 roadmap</a> regarding projects related to launch vehicle <strong>Structure and Mechanisms</strong>.  Feel free to brain storm potential projects related to this subsystem, evaluate any or all requirements, or otherwise comment on the suitability of this subsystem for the v 1.0 roadmap.  Note, the end result should be group consensus on requirements score and any notes to include on the evaluation page in the wiki.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I agree that having good CAD and CAE tools would be critical for doing very advanced work in this area.  I would probably say that should affect the admin score (as admin is to capture issues not directly related to our expertise but that can have significant impact on our ability to follow through with the projects).</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I'm most interested in this subsystem as my talents are in structures and mechanisms.</p>


	<p>How about we figure out how to use digital fabrication to make rocket structures and mechanisms? We could use laser cutters, 3D printers, and CNC machines. There are probably a lot of clever ways to introduce those into the toolchain so that the final rocket has better performance, or is at least cheaper to make and relatively easy to distribute. Also, this would merge in nicely with the direction the maker community is going already.</p>


	<p>Engineering expertise - (4) I'm pretty sure everyone can contribute to this at least a little bit. Even if we have to learn things, the equations for rocket bodies and control surfaces are one of the first things freshmen learn and there are even freely available calculators.<br />Fabrication - (3) We probably have the experience we'd need in digital fabrication to get started. I know I'm pretty good with a 3D printer. Acquiring expertise with 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines is straight forward and the barriers to entry are dropping every day. It's getting to where everyone in STEM either has one of them or wants one.<br />Mission - (5) Even if we never actually used it to make a rocket work better, this expertise is perfectly aligned with STEM, makers, and open source hardware. Beyond that, I'm pretty sure we could come up with some clever improvements to the rockets, or at least to manufacturing them, using digital fabrication.<br />Income - (2) Maybe. I give it a 2 because I figure M30 could charge for classes or course material or something like that. A big part of the point of digital fabrication is that you don't sell it you just let everyone download it. But if M30 became a leader in this area, or came up with something particularly clever, we could probably charge for that expertise.<br />Admin - (5) The USML mentions rocket motor mounts &#38; cases and flight control systems, but only for rockets covered by the first part. Since hobby/sport rockets aren't covered, their structures and mechanisms should be fair game, especially since the USML doesn't mention structures at all. It should be pretty easy to organize digital fabrication. Most of the design can be done by anyone with an internet connection and even the manufacture can be outsourced if necessary. It's relatively easy to have people in different locations participating in one design or design family. Organizing, documenting, and distributing the vast majority of the project can be done online and there would be a lot for assistants to do even if they aren't directly participating in the engineering or fabrication.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Matt, these are great points.  And I think your scores sound in line with what I might give (I will think about it tonight and try to score it fresh tomorrow).  I am glad to see a system with higher scores (I have been looking at some of the other systems that are harder for us to work on right now).</p></div>
