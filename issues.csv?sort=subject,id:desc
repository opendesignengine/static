I think it would be ideal if we could embed the compiled Arduino code with the Java UI, have the UI check the software version on the Arduino, and then upload the embedded code if the Arduino is out of date. This would make software version matching completely transparent to the user, and would take us another step closer to passing the ""Grandma Test"" with Shepard.

112,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Normal,Add Current and All Revisions Deletion of Images,"","","",Jeremy Wright,01/28/2013,"",0,"","",01/28/2013 04:08 pm,01/28/2013 04:08 pm,"ODE currently allows project managers to delete images from wiki docs. The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called ""Delete In This Revision"", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called ""Delete In All Revisions"", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.

One stepper motor will be connected directly to the end of each threaded rod (one stepper on the X axis and two, one on each long side of the table, for the Y axis) so that the threaded rod will rotate as the rotor rotates.  Rails on each long side of the table will support the weight of the gantry and guide its motion in the Y axis.  A rail on the gantry will support movement in the X axis.  At each weight-bearing location on the rails, two bearings on top and one or two on the bottom will help it roll more smoothly.  I guess drawings are more helpful that all this description, eh?"

In the first five units, I wasn't able to machine the enclosure lids or bodies to any reasonable tolerance, so my fits were poor. I had to compensate by using stepped drill bits to add a lot of slop to all the holes. 

I need to fabricate a registration guide/jig that I can clamp to my work-piece which allows me to more precisely align my drills. 

_*PROPOSED SOLUTION:*_ 

# dimension/draw enclosure lid perimter with mounting holes
# Use DXF to laser-cut a jig for the pilot holes - include perimeter with mounting holes for registration

??Brilliant idea! We have been looking for something like this for some time now. There is just one thing we really thing should be included: a web store.  If the site also incorporated some sort of selling mechanism for projects to supply (partially or fully manufactured) open hardware, we believe that there will be a much higher number of sustainable projects due to the accessibility of hardware to the community as well as the flow of funding to the projects. It may be as simple as integrating paypal (in which case there wouldn't require too much development) although the users would still need some sort of guidance/tutorial/template to get going.  
We are completely behind this project and have pledged our 25 buck, but if hardware sales and distribution were a more explicitly included, we will GLADLY up our backing!!  
Good luck with the remaining few days!??

Note, Feature #13 will partially serve this need, but having a fully integrated shopping cart would greatly simplify things for project owners and could create a revenue stream for both projects and ODE (as ODE could keep a small percentage of sales like ""KickStarter"":http://www.kickstarter.com/ and ""Pledgie"":http://pledgie.com/ do)."

Most of the time this is what you want since you want to make sure you're getting good temperature data. However, there are cases where you may want to run the test stand without a temperature sensor, or have damaged a temperature sensor and need it to run with only thrust measurements. The easiest way to do this would be to just give the caller a value of 0.0. For use with Shepard the temperature should never be 0.0 degrees C, so the user will be able to easily tell that they need to make sure the MLX sensor is connected if they want temperature measurements."

According to the documentation, we should be treating that value as an unsigned long, giving us up to 50 days before it rolls over.

http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/millis

To do this we'll have to account for the fact that a long on the Arduino is 32 bits. Currently we're only sending 16 bits over the wire to the client. Sending 32 bits will slow the data rate down slightly, but I'm not sure yet by how much."
