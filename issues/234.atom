&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this can still be done on the client side instead of changing anything on the Arduino.  When the client enacts a record action, either via user input as the Java app does now or via automatic detection, the recorded timestamps can all be adjusted to reflect T-0 where specified.  All times before than can be T-, and all times after be T+.  Or, we could just store the T-0 and T+ events.  Either way, I think this is something that the client can easily take care of.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;My worry with handing this off to the Arduino is that some data will be essentially lost in the sync from the client sending the signal.  The primary reason for this is the client doesn't read the data immediately as it's sent from the Arduino, but is buffered first, so there is some delay.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>
