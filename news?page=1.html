	<p><ins>What did not go well?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>The last 3 weeks things almost came to a grinding halt (external issues overcame both J and Bryan)</li>
		<li>Really concerned about all things communications (blog posts are still infrequent and we need to get the comms plan done!)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Note: we are very close to the SyndCon prep sprint</p>


	<p><ins>What can we do better?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>Be ruthless about prioritizing tasks while we are ultra-bandwidth limited (highest priority is to ship the alphas)</li>

	<li>Did
	<ul>
	<li>V04-26: Assemble a test Wings to verify design (on proto-wing) - fixed TRRS jack wiring and added version circuit on board 1 (board 1 is complete)</li>
		<li>BIZ-03: Work with Legal on Trademark Filing - met with J, gave feedback to graphic artist about image fixes (waiting for updates), gave go ahead to legal</li>
		<li>V04-13: Test the tone rings against the behavior of the existing 12 pole 3D printed design (at least same performance, but looking for faster response times and improved single stepping) - dropped due to findings above</li>
		<li>BIZ-06: Meet with SBDC Innovation and Commercialization Assistance Program - done</li>
