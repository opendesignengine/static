    <p>Winter break is over and we accomplished some nice bonus work during our down time (including finalizing design details and setting up the first prototype of a test stand for Holoseat components).  Now it is time to get back to our regular rhythm and wrap up the development work for the Alpha units so we can ship them to our testers.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>As a developer I want to design a "Wing" so that I can reduce risk to expensive components</li>
		<li>As a designer I want to determine the sensor mount adhesive so that we can include it in the alpha test</li>
		<li>As a manufacturer I want to source a manufactured tone ring so that I can reduce costs</li>
		<li>As a developer I want to enable required functionality so that I can handle basic configuration through the application (defaults and live for: enabled, single step duration, forward and backward chars)</li>
		<li>As a business owner I want to research site support for manufacturing process so that I can fill in gaps in organization knowledge and experience</li>
		<li>As a testing coordinator I want to evaulate the design so that I can avoid additional expenses from updates</li>
		<li>As a marketer I want to continue publishing blog posts once a month (on a consistent schedule) so that I have original content to share</li>
		<li>As a designer I want to develop a housings so that I can avoid having lose electronics sitting on the equipment</li>

	<p><strong>Retrospective</strong></p>


	<p><ins>What went well?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>All component level updates have been completed and verified (still need to verify a couple of assemblies using new components)</li>
		<li>New software architecture is completed and verified at firmware and software level</li>
		<li>Engaged with a lawyer, finally</li>
		<li>Engaged with Roanoke Small Biz Dev Council</li>
	</ul>


	<p><ins>What did not go well?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>Too many PBIs not done</li>
		<li>We did not attend all stand ups, or even virtual stand ups</li>
		<li>Did not do a job of engaging with volunteers</li>
		<li>Spent too much time in this and last sprint trying to engage DC biz dev center</li>
		<li>Got overly ambitious (just too many PBIs period - again!)</li>
		<li>Set unrealistic goals for Alpha delivery and have still not accepted what it will take to finish the Alphas</li>
		<li>Not prioritizing communication enough (especially outside of core dev team)</li>
		<li>Personal feelings of not doing a good job of personal time management and task list</li>
	</ul>


	<p><ins>What can we do better?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>Find additional volunteers (especially CAD and Marketing)</li>
		<li>Move "will do"s from stand ups each week to personal task list (on phone)</li>
		<li>Develop a metric for determining the size of a planned sprint and select an initial cut off point for max size of sprint work (to include how we address outsourced work)</li>
		<li>Avoid running short sprints in the future, and when we have to run short sprints, the total size of the sprint needs to be reduced from normal</li>
		<li>Reexamine how we address blocks so they are about what is preventing us from making progress</li>
		<li>Address lack of time to commit in how much and what goes into "will do" for a stand up (not treat as blocks)</li>
		<li>Prioritize handling real blocks to remove the thing preventing progress/recognize if block means PBI needs to be dropped from sprint</li>
		<li>Develop cookie-cutter set of external communication templates that are triggered by specific types of content/events (aka poor man's communication plan)</li>

    <div class="wiki">
    <p>The first iteration of Planning Year 2018 (PY18) is over.  While we accomplished many key tasks, I hesitate to call it a sprint (we never got to setting up a complete sprint plan).  It was more of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)" class="external">kanban</a> run straight off of the evolving backlog.  To say it was less than a perfect process is an understatement (you can see all the details in our <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/news/94" class="external">Review and Retrospective</a>).</p>


	<p>We have since finished grooming the PY18 backlog and we have looked at how moving to our new planning year cycle (SyndCon to SyndCon) impacts our annual cadence.  Based on this meta-planning work, we are calling the upcoming sprint Sprint 1A (this will put the rest of PY18 in sync with our proposed annual cadence).  See below for all of the PY18 Sprint 1A details.</p>


	<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 weeks<br /><strong>Stand Ups:</strong> Thursday nights<br /><strong>Start:</strong> Oct 26, 2017 <br /><strong>End:</strong> Dec 7, 2017</p>

	</ul>


	<p><strong>Retrospective</strong></p>


	<p><ins>What went well?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>The hardware testing</li>
		<li>Initial work on the new desktop app</li>
		<li>Getting testers through initial on boarding</li>
		<li>Got done about the right set of work at about the right time (especially considering we had no formal sprint plan)</li>
	</ul>


	<p><ins>What did not go well?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>No formal sprint plan - <em>What's a sprint plan?</em></li>
		<li>Hit the resource bottleneck again because we did not leverage outside resources (direct result of not having a formal sprint plan)</li>
		<li>The timing for annual planning and needing to get things rolling for the planning year was off</li>
		<li>Missed some stand ups (old habit coming back to haunt us) due to travel and other outside blocks</li>
		<li>Travel in general</li>
		<li>While we got a couple of blog posts got up, the social media continued to stagnate (related to resource constraints)</li>
	</ul>


	<p><ins>What can we do better?</ins></p>


	<ul>
	<li>We need to address annual planning; everything else that did not go well stems from not completing annual planning
	<ul>
	<li>In the rush to try to have delivery of alpha units by end of year, we cut annual planning short; last planning cycle took 3-4 weeks for planning</li>
		<li>Need to determine correct annual cadence for planning years running SyndCon to SyndCon</li>
		<li>Let's lay out the assumptions for our planning year
	<ul>
	<li>Year runs Sept to Aug</li>
		<li>Aug is just for SyndCon and recovery from SyndCon</li>
		<li>Planning year is broken into thirds which are ~2 sprints long each</li>
		<li>Sept is dedicated to planning (no development)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li><strong>Annual Cadence</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>Third 1
	<ul>
	<li>Sep: Planning</li>
		<li>Oct - Nov: Sprint 1</li>
		<li>Dec: Basically off (any development is out of cycle)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>Third 2
	<ul>
	<li>Jan - Feb: Sprint 2</li>
		<li>Mar - Apr: Sprint 3</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>Third 3
	<ul>
	<li>May - Jun: Sprint 4</li>
		<li>Jul - Aug: Sprint 5 (runs short to meet deadline for SyndCon; it is always dedicated to convention prep)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>We need to discuss how to apply this cadence through the end of calendar year 2017</li>
	</ul>
