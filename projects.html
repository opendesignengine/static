It is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard" class="external">Alan Shepard</a>, America's first astronaut, as it is our first test stand. The <strong>Shepard Test Stand</strong> uses an Arduino Uno with a custom shield to provide the physical interface between the data collecting computer and the required sensors.  This project is the first in a series of projects to develop the required skills for the practice of safe rocket engine operation, and to develop the capability to measure and record data about a rocket engine's performance.  The use of Estes class motors provides a relatively safe environment to learn in before moving to higher powered motors and engines.   The ultimate vision is to develop test stands for full scale liquid rocket engines for use in orbital launch systems....</p></div></div>
