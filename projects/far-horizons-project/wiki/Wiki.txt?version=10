h2. Introduction

Welcome to the *Far Horizons Project* Wiki. This wiki contains documentation covering the design, development, fabrication, and use of the Far Horizons High Altitude Balloon (HAB). Far Horizons is a program of Adler Planetarium in Chicago, IL, USA. One project of Far Horizons is this HAB platform, which affords researchers of all ages access to "near space" with a maximum altitude of approximately 100,000 feet (30480 meters). The Far Horizons HAB platform is being documented here in the hopes that it will facilitate the experiments of other people with an interest in HAB use and research.

The Far Horizons platform is just that, more of a floating "platform" with a frame that can hold instruments and cameras in a horizontal plane. This is different than the typical "train" designs that you see with many HAB designs.
