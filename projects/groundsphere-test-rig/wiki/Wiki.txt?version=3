h2. Introduction

Welcome to the *Ground Sphere Test Transmitter* wiki.  This is a "Mach 30":http://mach30.org/ project designed to give an initial "smoke test" for "Ground Sphere":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/groundsphere/wiki hardware before trying to receive "Skycube":http://www.southernstars.com/skycube/index.html transmissions from orbit.

h2. Ground Sphere for Makers

Mach 30 believes that Makers and Makerspaces will be a large part of the new spacefaring workforce, partnering with us in our mission "[t]o hasten the advancement of humanity into a spacefaring civilization through sustainable leadership, open design practices, and a bias toward mature technology." If that sounds like something you want to be involved in, we encourage you to jump right in. If you want to start with our design rationale, take a look at the _Systems Engineering Process_ section in the navigation bar at the right. If building, testing, and operating a ground station is more your speed, start with the _Documentation_ section of the navigation bar. Always make sure to read any "Safety Procedures":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/groundsphere/wiki/Safety_Procedures first so that you can have the safest experience possible with Ground Sphere and this project. Also, don't forget to "register for an Open Design Engine account":https://opendesignengine.net/account/register so you can start posting to the forums.

h2. Ground Sphere for Educators

We intend to have Ground Sphere kits available sometime in the first quarter of 2014. If you're interested in finding out more about Ground Sphere in education, please contact "Mach 30":http://mach30.org/contact . If you're planning to build and operate a Ground Sphere ground station on your own, please start by reading the "Safety Procedures.":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/groundsphere/wiki/Safety_Procedures

h2. Ground Sphere for Students

If you're a student who's ready to start working with Ground Sphere, be sure to start with the "Safety Procedures.":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/groundsphere/wiki/Safety_Procedures Once you're up to speed on those, you'll want to take a look at the "Operating Manual":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Operating_Manual to learn how to operate the ground station. Any other documentation that you may need should be in the navigation bar at the right under _Documentation_. Also, don't forget to "register for an Open Design Engine account":https://opendesignengine.net/account/register so you can start posting to the forums.
