h2. Procedure

h3. 1. Prepare Mounting Slot

# Do a test fit (without glue) of the *HSC-03: Controller Housing Base* and *HSC-10: Controller Housing Mounting Slot* by sliding the *Controller Housing Base* into the *Controller Housing Mounting Slot*
!step1.1-sm.jpg!
# Separate the *Controller Housing Base* into the *Controller Housing Mounting Slot*
# Apply super glue to the inner perimeter of the *Controller Housing Mounting Slot* where the *Controller Housing Base* will sit, taking care to keep glue out of the cut out for the slot; apply extra super glue to the large raised surface to ensure a strong bond.  See yellow lines in image below.
!step1.3-sm.jpg!
# Slide the *Controller Housing Base* into the *Controller Housing Mounting Slot* and press the pieces together per the glue's instructions (typically 1 minute)
# Allow the glue to cure per its instructions

h3. 2. Solder Headers to Feather

*TBD by Bryan*

h3. 3. Assemble Controller Components

# Attach *HSC-08: TRRS Wing* to underside headers on *HSC-02: Holoseat Controller Wing*
!step3.1-sm.jpg!
# Attach *TRRS Wing + Controller Wing* to *Feather*
!step3.2-sm.jpg!
# Attach *HSC-09: Keyswitch* to *Controller Wing* (note, the LED on the *Keyswitch* should be on the left side when the *TRRS Wing* is toward you)

h3. 4. Install Firmware and Test Controller

*TBD by J. when test and firmware code is updated*

h3. 5. Final Assembly

# Insert *Feather + Wings* into *HSC-03: Controller Housing Base*
!step5.1-sm.jpg!
# Attach *HSC-04: Controller Housing Top* onto *Controller Housing Base* making sure the snap fit connection fully clicks and the inset over TRRS connector seats fully into the *Controller Housing Base*
