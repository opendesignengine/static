Much of this material was reviewed with the stakeholders and the IPT at the "Sprint 1 Stand Up 3 meeting":https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Wc4sMqlUissR5am6ANDcKP-psRQ41ysxOV0vrcgHJA/pub

* Online Forms - useful for one off calculations, source code/math not necessarily available to Mach 30
** "Satellite Link Budget Calculator":http://www.satsig.net/linkbugt.htm - simple online form for uplink and downlink calculations
** "Satellite Link Budget Calculator page":http://www.tutorialsweb.com/satcom/satellite-link-budget-calculator.htm - a mor complete set of calculations for uplink and downlink
** "Geostationary Satellite Link Budget Calculations (Downlink)":http://www.satcom-services.com/VSAT/downlink.html - Geo calculations, not really useful for us, but nice user experience
* Spreadsheets - require correct software to run, but Mach 30 can investigate the implementation to use as a source for porting to Python library

h2. Selected Link Budget Source Document

The Ground Sphere Mk 3 team has decided to build its Python Link Budget library on the calculations used in the "KickSat Ground Station Link Budget":https://github.com/kicksat/groundstation/blob/master/Link%20Budgets.xlsx.  This spreadsheet includes nearly all of the required transmission effects and has been verified by "comparing its results to manual calculations":http://opendesignengine.net/dmsf_files/523?download=.
