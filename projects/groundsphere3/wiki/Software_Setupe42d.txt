h2. Introduction

These instructions cover the software set up of the Ground Sphere Mk3.

Note, these steps are for Windows (tested on Windows 10).

h2. 1. Download required Software

# Download the following files
## "Windows SDR Package (SDR Sharp)":https://airspy.com/download/ (ver 1.0.0.1443)
## "WXtoImg": https://wxtoimgrestored.xyz/downloads/ (ver 2.10.11)
## "VBCable": https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/ (pack 43)

h2. 2. Install Arduino IDE

# Run the Arduino IDE installer
# Configure the Arduino IDE to work with the Feather board
Complete details are available at learn.adafruit.com: "General details":https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/arduino-1-dot-6-x-ide | "Feather specific details":https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-basic-proto/using-with-arduino-ide
## Launch the Arduino IDE 
## Open the Arduino IDE Preferences by selecting *File>Preferences* from the menu
## Add @https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json@ to the *Additional Boards Manager URLs* field
## Click the *OK* button to save the new preferences
## Launch the Boards Manager by selecting *Tools>Board>Board Manager* from the menu
## Select _Contributed_ from the *Type* select box
## Select _Adafruit AVR Boards by Adafruit_ in the list of contributed boards then click the *Install* button
## Click the *Close* button, then exit out of the Arduino IDE (you may optionally relaunch the Arduino IDE and verify the list of boards under *Tools>Board* includes the Adafruit Feather)
## *ON WINDOWS ONLY* Install the Windows Adafruit Drivers (optional: only select the _Feather 32u4_ to minimize the number of drivers installed)

h2. 3. Install Firmware on Holoseat Controller

# Launch the Arduino IDE
# Plug the Holoseat controller into a USB port
# Set the board type to _Adafruit Feather 32u4_ by selecting *Tools>Board>Adafruit Feather 32u4* in the menu
# Set the port the Feather is connected to by selecting *Tools>Port>COM# (Adafruit Feather 32u4)* in the menu where # is an integer (see figure)
!SelectComPort.png!
# Open the Holoseat firmware in the Arduino by selecting *File>Open* and navigating to Documents\Holoseat\Firmware\holoseat_firmware\holoseat_firmware.ino
# Confirm the firmware compiles by clicking the *Verify* button (with the check mark icon)
# Flash the Holoseat controller with the firmware by clicking the *Upload* button (with the right facing arrow icon)

h2. 4. Install Desktop Configuration App

The desktop configuration app does not currently require any installation steps.  You can run it directly from Documents\Holoseat\HoloseatConfigurationUtility
