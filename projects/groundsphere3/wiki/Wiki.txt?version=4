h1. Welcome to Ground Sphere Mk 3

<create a nice landing page for the wiki> - example here - https://opendesignengine.net/projects/mtk/wiki/Wiki

Mach 30 is currently running an Open-source hardware project to develop a kit for a cheap and simple satellite ground receiver to listen to radio transmissions from the ISS.  We're calling it GroundSphere V3 or mark3, and right now we have a collection of possible designs from which we are about to pick one or two to build as prototypes.  We're looking for help from makers to participate in our "market research" to see if these chosen designs are feasible
