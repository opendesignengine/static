	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>GSR 10.1</strong> If possible, the first ground station should be completed within 3 months of formal launch as an exercise in agile design and project management.  It should be noted that this amounts to only the antenna system and software installation on the computer system.</li>

	<a name="Future-V20-Requirements"></a>
<h3 >Future V2.0 Requirements<a href="Requirements_Document.html#Future-V20-Requirements" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>These are for reference only so that future features can be accommodated in the current design where practical.</p>


<strong>Version 2.0:</strong>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>GSR 5.1</strong> Direct computer control of receive and transmit frequencies to automatically compensate for doppler shift.  Requires a supported radio as listed <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/attachments/209/Supported_Radios.xls" class="external">here.</a></li>
		<li><strong>GSR 5.2</strong> A higher gain directional antenna system (such as X-yagis), an antenna rotator assembly which connects to the computer to automatically control azimuth and elevation.</li>
	</ul>


<strong>Beyond Version 2.0:</strong>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>GSR 5.5</strong> Version 3.0 will use a Software Defined Radio (SDR) as a receiver for higher sensitivity, direct recording, data demodulation (digital modes), and visualization of the downlink feed.</li>
		<li><strong>GSR 5.6</strong> Version 4.0 will feature the addition of a dish to the tracking assembly as well as an L-band SDR transciever to hit the command and control frequencies.  This will doubtless require more software to send commands and receive telemetry.</li>
		<li><strong>GSR 5.7</strong> Version 5.0 will feature real time conversion of data and audio streams into a VPN'd link to a common database and network would allow multiple ground stations to act as one.  This would require time stamping the packets and synchronizing using high precision GPS receivers on each ground station.</li>
	</ul>
