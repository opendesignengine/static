h2. Introduction

Below are the assembly instructions for the v0.3 *Holoseat*.  The controller for this version is built using an "AdaFruit Feather 32u4 Basic Proto":https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771.  The sensors are on a remotely mountable board. Final assembly requires an appropriate set of under desk exercise pedals (we recommend *"DeskCycle":https://www.amazon.com/DeskCycle-Exercise-Pedal-Exerciser-White/dp/B00B1VDNQA/* or *"FitDesk":https://www.amazon.com/FitDesk-Under-Desk-Elliptical/dp/B00Y1FRULM/* ). Note, you will need to use your soldering skills on this build.

h3. Procedure - Holoseat Final Assembly

The primary objective for the final assembly is to mount the Sensor Board and the HS010 (magnet) on your chosen under desk exercise pedals.  At this point in the development we are using easily reversible assembly processes (read tape) so we do not damage the exercise pedals.  Note, for convenience these instructions show the Sensor Board and Controller mounted in small plastic containers (e.g. travel toothbrush holders or similar).

# Use the *HS006 - Cat5e cable* to connect the Sensor Board to the Controller
# Plug the Controller into the computer using the *HS009 - USB cable*, the sensor lights should both light up
# Place the Sensor Board on top the exercise pedals so the sensors can be placed along the path of the right hand bar of the pedals
# Tack in place with two strips of tape
# Place the sensors in position.  Tacking them down with tape as needed.  Be sure to mount them in the same orientation (e.g. the writing faces out for both sensors) to ensure they will both read the magnet as the sensors have a polarity.
The cadence sensor (connected to the Blue/White striped lead on the Sensor Board) should be placed ahead of the direction sensor (connected to the Green lead on the Sensor Board) when pedaling.  This will be to the left if looking at the sensors from the side of the exercise pedals.  Be sure both sensor are in the same arc of the pedal bar so they can both be triggered when the magnet is in place.
# Place the *HS010 - magnet* on the right hand bar of the pedals in line with the arc of the two sensors (it should attach to the pedal bar through its magnetic field)
# Adjust the position of the sensors and *HS010 - magnet* such that each sensor is triggered (indicated by the light switching off as the pedal bar passes the sensor) one at a time (see image below)
If neither sensor is triggered try flipping the magnet over (in case of a polarity mismatch) or moving the magnet closer to the arc of the sensors (in case the magnet is beyond the range of the sensors).  If both sensors are triggered at the same time try separating the sensors along the path of the arc.

# Once the sensors and *HS010 - magnet* are in position, add sufficient tape to permanently mount the sensors and then the Sensor Board
