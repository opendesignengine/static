h2. Procedure

h3. 1. Assemble the exercise equipment

Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to assemble the exercise equipment (supported exercise equipment includes DeskCycle and DeskCycle 2).  Note, you should stop after you have completed the steps covering installing the equipment's feet and pedals.  Holoseat will replace the included "bike computer".

h3. 2. Attach Tone Ring

Requires: exercise equipment, tone ring, and hex key

# Use included hex key to remove the two screws from the tone ring
# Pull the two tone ring halves apart
# Place the exercise equipment with the right hand side facing you
# Place the two tone ring halves around the axle, taking care to line the screw holes away from the crank arm (otherwise the crank arm will block access to the screws in later steps)
!step2.4_sm.jpg!
# Press the two tone ring halves together until they fit snugly over the axle and the screw holes line up (you will need to maintain pressure on the Tone Ring halves until both screws have been replaced)
!step2.5_sm.jpg!
# Use the included hex key to replace one of the screws you removed in step 2.1, taking care to maintain pressure on the tone ring halves and to keep the screw straight as it goes in. Do not over tighten or you may strip the threads

# Repeat step 2.6 with the other screw
