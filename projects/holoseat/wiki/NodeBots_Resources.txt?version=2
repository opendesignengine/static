h1. NodeBots Resources

{{>toc}}

J. is investigating how to automate the test rig to minimize user induced error during sensor comparison tests and later performance tests.  This plan was inspired by working with Nodebots.

h2. Examples

* "Practical Introduction to iot with Arduino + Node.js + Plotly":http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/07/practical-introduction-iot-arduino-nodejs-plotly/ - older plot.ly info, but still a good resource
* "Tutorial that uses sqlite and Node.js":https://cozy.io/en/hack/getting-started/first-app.html - really about "Cozy":https://cozy.io/en/, but covers sqlite with Node.js which looks like a good choice if we run the test rig from an RPi
* "Real Time Weather Data Visualizations with socket.io and D3.js":http://www.bmc.med.utoronto.ca/bmcwiki/doku.php/technology:media_technologies:technology:dataviz_d3
