h2. Procedure

h3. 1. Place Magnets

# Select a *18PTR-03: N52 3/16" x 3/16" Neodymium Cylinder Magnet* and place it length wise into one of the slots in the *18PTR-01: 18 Pole Tone Ring Base*

# Select another magnet and find its polarity by placing it along the outside edge so that it becomes attracted to the previous magnet
# Rotate the magnet from the previous step 180 degrees (so that the pole attracted to the previous magnet is facing out to create a pole pair) and place it in the next slot in the base

# Repeat the previous two steps until the tone ring is fully populated

h3. 3. Verify Magnet Placement

# Set up the Holoseat Test Stand
## Ensure the calibrated sensor is attached to the sensor controller
## Ensure the power and USB connections are all configured according to the test stand operating instructions
## Place the new tone ring onto the tone ring adapter
# Run test
## Clear the sensor stats
## Run the stepper motor 1 revolution, in a CW direction, at 30 RPM
## Get the sensor stats and verify the number of reported poles is 18
# Remove the tone ring from the tone ring adapter

h3. 4. Complete the Tone Ring

# Align and place the *18PTR-02: Tone Ring Cover* over the *18PTR-01: 18 Pole Tone Ring Base*
