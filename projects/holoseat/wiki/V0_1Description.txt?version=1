h1. V0.1 Description

Initial prototype - This is the proof of concept for the *Holoseat*.  It uses a USB Keyboard controller board, an Arduino Uno, and a reed switch (which replaced a homemade rotary encoder).  It has been in use for 8 months with few problems.  It will be replaced with a simpler v0.2 prototype which will replace the USB keyboard controller and Arduino Uno with an Arduino Leonardo.
