h1. V0.3 Description

Improved Prototype - this version of the *Holoseat* will apply lessons learned from the previous versions and work to make the *Holoseat* more robust in preparation for a production prototype.  In particular, it will look into the use of "Hall effect":http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/HallEffect sensors in place of the reed switch and it will investigate the use of a desktop application to interact with the *Holoseat* to adjust the configuration and get feedback from the *Holoseat* controller.  Specific development will include:

* Testing the use of Hall effect sensors
* Support for "reverse walking"
* -Support for "running" vs "walking" based on step rate in games which support two speeds of movement-
* Updated documentation including improved instructions (format, drawings from Fritzing instead of photos, etc)
* Development of a desktop client (Windows only for this version) which will
** Support updating the controller's firmware
** Manage configuration (save defaults to the *Holoseat* controller, adjust live settings that reset to defaults on controller restart)
** -*Holoseat* activity reporting (number of steps in this session, this hour, this day, this week, this month, this year, “life”)-
** -Potentially tie into website for badges, etc based on activity level and games played-
** -Support weigh ins?-
