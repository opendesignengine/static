	<p>Welcome to the Holoseat Wiki. Holoseat is a gaming peripheral for PCs (it works with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux) that turns your video games into workouts.  Every step you take in your game is driven by pedaling in the real world.  Using Holoseat is an immersive experience (players pedal faster when their characters are in danger) and invisible.  This combination masks the exercise experience in game play, transforming exercise from a chore into a natural part of a gamer's day.  In short, Holoseat <em>exerfies your games</em>!</p>


	<p>Holoseat is an <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware" class="external">open source hardware</a></strong> project and all aspects of its development are managed on <a href="https://opendesignengine.net" class="external">Open Design Engine</a>.  As an open source hardware project, you have access to all of the design details of Holoseat and can participate in any manner you want.  Do you want to follow along with the development team until we release the first commercial version?  Great, check out the <em>Want to learn more?</em> section.  Do you just have to have a Holoseat of your own right now?  No problem, check out the <em>Want to build your own?</em> section.  Do you have an idea for how to improve Holoseat?  Do you want to help us bring Holoseat to market (this includes technical and business development work)?  Awesome!  Check out the <em>Want to join the Holoseat team?</em> section.</p>
