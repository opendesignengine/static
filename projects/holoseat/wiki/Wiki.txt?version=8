Welcome to the Holoseat Wiki. Holoseat is a gaming peripheral for PCs (it works with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux) that turns your video games into workouts.  Every step you take in your game is driven by pedaling in the real world.  Using Holoseat is an immersive experience (players pedal faster when their characters are in danger) and invisible.  This combination masks the exercise experience in game play, transforming exercise from a chore into a natural part of a gamer's day.  In short, Holoseat _exerfies your games_!

Holoseat is an open source hardware project and all aspects of its development are managed on "Open Design Engine":https://opendesignengine.net.
