h1. Structures and Mechanisms Card Storming

h2. Unsorted list of ideas

* DIGITAL FABRICATION OF COMPONENTS AND MECHANISMS
* AN OPEN PLATFORM OF STANDARDS (Like LEGOS)
* PAYLOAD MOUNT FOR ARDUINOS
* UPGRADED ELECTRONICS PAYLOAD STRUCTURES - LIKE FOR FIN-FACING CAMERAS
* FABRICATION IN MAKERSPACES WITH LOCAL TOOLS
* EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES
* SOFTWARE TOOLS - CODECAD AND OPENSOURCECAD (CADQUERY)
* COLLAPSIBLE AND EXPANDABLE MECHANISMS (“ORAGAMI ROCKET”)
* THE “BLACK BOX” FOR MODEL ROCKET (CHEAP, DURABLE, RECOVERABLE, LIKE www.carbonorigins.com)
* HARDWARE TOOLS AND JIGS
* SCALABLE PARTS, AND THE ASSOCIATED STANDARDS FOR USING THEM
* SOFTWARE - STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS TOOLS (LIKE FEA, NASTRAN, etc.)
* (linked to propulsion as well) PROPULSION TEST STAND STRUCTURE
* (stretching outside the box a bit) SCALE MODEL OF A SIMULATED LAUNCH COMPLEX.  FULL GROUND OPS SIMULATION
* (linked in to aerodynamics as well) FIN DESIGN BASED ON J’S MASTERS THESIS (OPTIMIZING SUPERSONIC STRUCTURES TO PREVENT FLUTTER)
* STRUCTURAL TESTING (DESTRUCTIVE OR OTHERWISE)
* STRUCTURAL DESIGN BEST PRACTICES FOR MANUFACTURING, AND OPERATIONS, (AKA LIFECYCLE CONSIDERATION)
* STRUCTURAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT
* MATERIALS TESTING FORM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE (UV, THERMAL, (eventually) VACUUM
* STRUCTURAL INCORPORATION OF A “MISSION OBJECTIVE” (like rube goldburg, or scientific experiment)
* (linked to electrical/power)  HOW TO INCORPORATE POWER STORAGE INTO STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS
* ADDRESSING REUSABILITY CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS
* HIGH-RELIABILITY RECOVERY SYSTEM (MECHANISMS)
* (building on Legos idea) Modular model rocket kit (1 kit, several rockets; maybe based around "NARTREK":http://www.nar.org/model-rocket-info/nartek-skills-program/ missions)
* Structural Analysis software for both dynamic and static analysis
* Launch Pad design/structures
* Go extermely small size (Just how small can I get it?)
> * sharing files, etc
> * educational/entertainment
> * very open source
* Evaluation/research of tools and machines required to build rockets at scale we are looking at -> Toolset analysis
* Make sure the materials research covers non-obvious choices (to us at least) like composites, etc
* unconventional rockets, like rocket/jet-powered rotors
