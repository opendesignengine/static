This project is a series of workbenches and other workshop furniture inspired by the workbenches in the "Wilderness Workshop":http://makezine.com/23/diyworkshop_worktables/ article in "Make 23":http://makezine.com/23/.  The furniture in the project is sturdy, affordable, and easy to assemble.  The current plans include four foot square work tables, and four foot wide benches that go against the wall for fixed placed power tools.
