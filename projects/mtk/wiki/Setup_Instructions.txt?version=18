These instructions were developed using a PC laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.

# Download the "install script":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/mtk/repository/revisions/36/raw/trunk/install/linux/mtk_setup_script.sh from the MTK repository (rev 36 is the current working build)
# Open a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded the install script (e.g. ~/Downloads/)
# Add execute permissions to the install script 
@chmod +x ./mtk_setup_script.sh@
# Run the install script (you will be prompted for your password as the script uses sudo)
@./mtk_setup_script.sh@ 
# Be patient and answer yes to any prompts (the install script needs to download, install, and update a number of tools to fully configure MTK)
