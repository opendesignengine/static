Mach 30 believes documentation is essential to creating high quality engineering analysis and that integrating documentation steps into the engineering process is the key to ensuring documentation is created and maintained.  The Mathematics Tool Kit (MTK) is a unified engineering analysis and documentation tool created to address these needs. 

MTK is built on existing open source tools including "IPython":http://ipython.org/, "Jupyter":https://jupyter.org/ (and "several extensions":https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions), "Pint":http://pint.readthedocs.org/, and "Spyder":https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/ (coming soon).  The goal is to create a tool that makes it easy to switch between (and focus on) engineering analysis and documentation tasks, all in an environment optimized for engineers (e.g. built in support for units as first class mathematical constructs via Pint).  A notional view of MTK is shown below (Spyder-windows-screenshot" by Joshdoe at en.wikipedia; "IPython-notebook" by Shishirdasika).
