&lt;p&gt;The DMSF module has a non descriptive name that's confusing for people who come to a page looking for information. It would be nice to be able to set aliases for tab names so that ambiguity could be cleared up. I would think this would have to be done on a site-wide administrative level though. Otherwise every project would have their own, possibly incompatible, names for the DMSF plugin.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;When posting a comment to a News item, there is no option to preview what you've written. There is also no edit feature available for comments after you post them. You have to delete the comment and then re-post it. When using the News feature as a Developer Log it makes things cumbersome. I wonder if we're getting to a point where we need a Dev Log module that would incorporate these things instead of using the News module. It was never intended for what we're using it for.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;ODE currently allows project managers to delete images from wiki docs. The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called "Delete In This Revision", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called "Delete In All Revisions", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;The Projects page would be cleaned up considerably if the sub-projects listed under each main project could be collapsed. It would be similar to the way sub-directories are listed in a file manager program on Linux, Windows, or MacOS, and can be collapsed so that you only see the parent directory.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;I was added to a project today by someone else, and it got me thinking. There's no confirmation that I've ever seen when you're added to a project, and you don't get a chance to decline the invitation. That means you could be added to a project unknowingly, even a project that you don't want to be associated with, without your knowledge or warning. This isn't a big deal now, but if/when ODE grows into the SoureForge of the hardware world, it may become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Browser size often causes rendering issues with embedded images and videos (which have a fixed size in the current implementation).  See the attached screenshot for an example.  We should look at automatically resizing these elements to fit the frame they are rendered in.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Idea originally submitted as comment on KickStarter Campaign by &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1722694026" class="external"&gt;Jarryd Bekker&lt;/a&gt;.  His comment is quoted below.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brilliant idea! We have been looking for something like this for some time now. There is just one thing we really thing should be included: a web store.  If the site also incorporated some sort of selling mechanism for projects to supply (partially or fully manufactured) open hardware, we believe that there will be a much higher number of sustainable projects due to the accessibility of hardware to the community as well as the flow of funding to the projects. It may be as simple as integrating paypal (in which case there wouldn't require too much development) although the users would still need some sort of guidance/tutorial/template to get going.  &lt;br /&gt;We are completely behind this project and have pledged our 25 buck, but if hardware sales and distribution were a more explicitly included, we will GLADLY up our backing!!  &lt;br /&gt;Good luck with the remaining few days!&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Note, Feature &lt;a href="http://opendesignengine.net/issues/13" class="issue status-3 priority-2 closed" title="Create a donation drive module (Resolved)"&gt;#13&lt;/a&gt; will partially serve this need, but having a fully integrated shopping cart would greatly simplify things for project owners and could create a revenue stream for both projects and ODE (as ODE could keep a small percentage of sales like &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" class="external"&gt;KickStarter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pledgie.com/" class="external"&gt;Pledgie&lt;/a&gt; do).&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this &lt;a href="http://projects.plural.cc/projects/redmine-youtube" class="external"&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt;  It could be a good start, but we should expand it to support other hosting services (like &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/" class="external"&gt;vimeo&lt;/a&gt;) and locally hosted videos.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;There will be many common types of wiki pages (meeting minutes, Bills of Materials, assembly instructions, etc).  ODE should support templates for these common types of wiki pages.  The templates should be sharable (link on page create by template, plus searchable on site), and be markable as "featured" so the best practices can spread through the community.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

&lt;p&gt;Source code control for embedded systems or computer based controls, etc should be stored in one of the available Version Control Systems (VCS) such as SVN, bzr, git, etc.  But engineering documents offer challenges that VCS do not handle well (very large, on order of GB files, primarily binary files).  Here are some specific requirements for engineering documents.  (Should investigate Enterprise CMS like &lt;a href="http://www.alfresco.com/products/dm/" class="external"&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; for underlying capabilities, as many of the features below are available in this class of tools.)&lt;/p&gt;    </content>
