* not removing old releases
* sub-optimal handling of config files
* error with migration logging

We should address these issues and just in general tighten up the deployment script."

This is due to the recent updates to rails and friends. We should remove these files from the repository, just to keep things squeaky clean."

And I just noticed something that I think is part of what makes the site just a little bit clunky.  Different tabs in projects either have or do not have the right hand side navigation bar.  Go check out the Overview tab, the Activity tab, the News tab, and the Wiki tab for examples.  You will go back and forth between having a right hand side navigation bar and not having one.  This inconsistency creates a jerkiness.  If every tab had a navigation bar, it would cut down on dramatic changes in rendering (smoothing out the user experience) and create a consistent location for users to look for navigation and additional controls."
