??Brilliant idea! We have been looking for something like this for some time now. There is just one thing we really thing should be included: a web store.  If the site also incorporated some sort of selling mechanism for projects to supply (partially or fully manufactured) open hardware, we believe that there will be a much higher number of sustainable projects due to the accessibility of hardware to the community as well as the flow of funding to the projects. It may be as simple as integrating paypal (in which case there wouldn't require too much development) although the users would still need some sort of guidance/tutorial/template to get going.  
We are completely behind this project and have pledged our 25 buck, but if hardware sales and distribution were a more explicitly included, we will GLADLY up our backing!!  
Good luck with the remaining few days!??

Note, Feature #13 will partially serve this need, but having a fully integrated shopping cart would greatly simplify things for project owners and could create a revenue stream for both projects and ODE (as ODE could keep a small percentage of sales like ""KickStarter"":http://www.kickstarter.com/ and ""Pledgie"":http://pledgie.com/ do)."

112,New,Open Design Engine,Feature,Normal,Add Current and All Revisions Deletion of Images,"","","",Jeremy Wright,01/28/2013,"",0,"","",01/28/2013 04:08 pm,01/28/2013 04:08 pm,"ODE currently allows project managers to delete images from wiki docs. The problem is that this deletes the images for all previous revisions of the doc, and not just the current revision. This makes the creation of versioning schemes which link back to older revisions ineffective because some of the original content is lost. Managers do still need the ability to permanently and completely delete offensive images that have been posted to the wiki though. Because of this, ODE needs two types of image deletion. The first could be called ""Delete In This Revision"", which only deletes the image for the current revision. The other type of deletion could be called ""Delete In All Revisions"", which would purge the image from the wiki history completely.
