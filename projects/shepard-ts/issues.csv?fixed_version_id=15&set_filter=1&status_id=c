This is one of a few backwards incompatibility issues that CCSSC has run into trying to get the software up and running for Shepard 1.1. I'm not sure whether it's worth putting the effort into it since Shepard 2.0 will be a big departure from the current software."

134,Closed,Shepard Test Stand,Bug,Normal,Shepard Data Collection Software Will Not Run On Processing 2.0+,Jeremy Wright,"",v1.1 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,06/24/2013,"",0,"","",06/24/2013 07:23 am,07/30/2013 10:38 am,"Between their beta version 2.0b7 and the official release of 2.0, Processing broke backwards compatibility with some core language elements that the graphical library we're using (controlP5) depends on. There were no deprecation warnings that came up in the compiler window that I ever saw. controlP5 hasn't been updated since December of 2012, and there are only three options I can think of for dealing with this:

# Place a restriction in the documentation that says the software can only be run in Processing 2.0b7 and below.
# Attempt to update the controlP5 library and commit the changes back.
# Recreate only the graphical elements we need and dump controlP5.

I haven't delved into the source code yet, so I'm not sure how hard the second option will be. I would prefer that the software be compatible with newer versions of Processing, but we'll probably be switching away from Processing for Shepard 2.0. I don't want to sink a bunch of time into something that's going to be shelved. That would also exclude option 3, but after looking at controlP5 more closely it seems that it's LGPL licensed, which is only compatible in one direction with our Apache 2.0 licensing. If we want this (pre Shepard 2.0) version of the software to be used for a long time to come, option 3 is the best option in my opinion. If the software is going to be shelved once Shepard 2.0 is released, then we should probably go with option 1."

A control byte needs to be sent from a connected client to the Arduino to tell it to start transmitting data.

It needs to be integrated into the DAQ system and tested to see if it is adequate.
