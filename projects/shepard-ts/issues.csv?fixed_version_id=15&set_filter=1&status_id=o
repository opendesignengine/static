155,New,Shepard Test Stand,Bug,High,Research Whether or Not the 30 Foot Safety Radius For E Motors is Necessary,Jeremy Wright,"",v1.1 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,08/01/2013,"",0,"","",08/01/2013 10:34 pm,08/01/2013 10:34 pm,"There has been discussion that the 30 foot safety radius for the E motors may be more about the increased risk of horizontal movement of a rocket with an E motor than the explosive force that can be generated by one. Research needs to be done, including contacting Estes and the NAR (National Association of Rocketry), to find out exactly why the radius for an E was chosen."
