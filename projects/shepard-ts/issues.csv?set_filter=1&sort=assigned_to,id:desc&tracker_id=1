157,Feedback,Shepard Test Stand,Bug,High,Time Stamp Bit Size Wrong On Arduino and Client,Jeremy Wright,"",v2.0 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,08/13/2013,"",0,1.0,"",08/13/2013 09:58 pm,01/06/2014 01:54 pm,"On the client side (laptop) we have been reading the time stamp (via the millis function) as a signed integer. According to the documentation, we should be treating that value as an unsigned long, giving us up to 50 days before it rolls over.

To do this we'll have to account for the fact that a long on the Arduino is 32 bits. Currently we're only sending 16 bits over the wire to the client. Sending 32 bits will slow the data rate down slightly, but I'm not sure yet by how much."
155,New,Shepard Test Stand,Bug,High,Research Whether or Not the 30 Foot Safety Radius For E Motors is Necessary,Jeremy Wright,"",v1.1 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,08/01/2013,"",0,"","",08/01/2013 10:34 pm,08/01/2013 10:34 pm,"There has been discussion that the 30 foot safety radius for the E motors may be more about the increased risk of horizontal movement of a rocket with an E motor than the explosive force that can be generated by one. Research needs to be done, including contacting Estes and the NAR (National Association of Rocketry), to find out exactly why the radius for an E was chosen."
