157,Feedback,Shepard Test Stand,Bug,High,Time Stamp Bit Size Wrong On Arduino and Client,Jeremy Wright,"",v2.0 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,08/13/2013,"",0,1.0,"",08/13/2013 09:58 pm,01/06/2014 01:54 pm,"On the client side (laptop) we have been reading the time stamp (via the millis function) as a signed integer. According to the documentation, we should be treating that value as an unsigned long, giving us up to 50 days before it rolls over.

http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/millis

To do this we'll have to account for the fact that a long on the Arduino is 32 bits. Currently we're only sending 16 bits over the wire to the client. Sending 32 bits will slow the data rate down slightly, but I'm not sure yet by how much."
155,New,Shepard Test Stand,Bug,High,Research Whether or Not the 30 Foot Safety Radius For E Motors is Necessary,Jeremy Wright,"",v1.1 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,08/01/2013,"",0,"","",08/01/2013 10:34 pm,08/01/2013 10:34 pm,"There has been discussion that the 30 foot safety radius for the E motors may be more about the increased risk of horizontal movement of a rocket with an E motor than the explosive force that can be generated by one. Research needs to be done, including contacting Estes and the NAR (National Association of Rocketry), to find out exactly why the radius for an E was chosen."
234,New,Shepard Test Stand,Feature,Normal,Arduino - Move Timestamp Zero Control to Arduino Instead of Client,Jeremy Wright,"",v2.0 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,12/10/2013,"",0,"","",12/10/2013 10:34 am,12/10/2013 11:26 am,"Look at the conversation starting at 12-05-13 for details on this feature request.

https://opendesignengine.net/boards/4/topics/387

The summary is that currently, the client decides when to set the 0 point for the time stamp (essentially starting the timer). The current thought is that this should be done on the Arduino's side to keep the timestamp control as close to the data source as possible. There may be a performance trade-off for adding this overhead to the Arduino though."
176,New,Shepard Test Stand,Feature,Normal,Add Compulsory Version Matching Between Arduino and Java App,Christopher Sigman,"",v2.0 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,09/18/2013,"",0,"","",09/18/2013 10:58 am,09/18/2013 10:58 am,"Version matching between the Arduino code and the Java UI is going to be important. In most cases they'll need to be lock-stepped to ensure proper operation.

I think it would be ideal if we could embed the compiled Arduino code with the Java UI, have the UI check the software version on the Arduino, and then upload the embedded code if the Arduino is out of date. This would make software version matching completely transparent to the user, and would take us another step closer to passing the ""Grandma Test"" with Shepard.

173,New,Shepard Test Stand,Feature,Normal,"Add a ""wizard"" mode for the Shepard GUI",Christopher Sigman,"",v2.0 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Christopher Sigman,09/12/2013,"",0,"",174,09/12/2013 10:20 pm,09/15/2013 08:38 am,"The current GUI is set up in more of an ""expert"" format, where all of the options for controlling the hardware and GUI are immediately available.  It would be good for many situations though to have the control options simplified into a guided, step-by-step format.  The steps would be:
# Connect
# Calibrate
# Set Test Notations
# Record
# Stop Recording
# Clear
After the last step, this test ""wizard"" would put the user back at step 3 for another test."
154,New,Shepard Test Stand,Feature,Normal,Return 0.0 For Temperature if IR Sensor is Not Connected,Jeremy Wright,"",v2.0 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype,Jeremy Wright,07/30/2013,"",0,"","",07/30/2013 10:17 pm,12/10/2013 07:47 am,"Currently the Arduino will hang if it's can't address the MLX90614 IR temperature sensor. Most of the time this is what you want since you want to make sure you're getting good temperature data. However, there are cases where you may want to run the test stand without a temperature sensor, or have damaged a temperature sensor and need it to run with only thrust measurements. The easiest way to do this would be to just give the caller a value of 0.0. For use with Shepard the temperature should never be 0.0 degrees C, so the user will be able to easily tell that they need to make sure the MLX sensor is connected if they want temperature measurements."

We currently have the 3.3 volt version for Shepard v1.1. We need to switch to the 5 volt version so that it and the load cell can be on a common voltage.
