h1. Shepard Test Stand Budget v1.1

This is a newer document based on "this one":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Budget_v1_0 , and you should refer to that original version if you want to see the revision history.

h3. Overview

The budget is $200, firm. If there is a conflict between function and budget, for this iteration, budget should trump. Our goal is not to make the perfect test stand, it is to upgrade the first prototype (v1.0) of the test stand in a way that gives us an upgrade path to v2.0 and beyond. In the process we will continue to learn both about test stands, and about our processes within our distributed design framework. Holding to a firm budget minimizes the amount of time spent trying to make the stand perfect (once you are out of money, you have to wrap up the project, successful or not). Even an "unsuccessful" prototype will teach us important lessons to apply moving forward. This budget does not include "consumables" such as motors, nor tools, but the $200 cost for the stand itself keeps the basic project affordable if standard tools found in Makerspaces can be used. Any manufacturing that has to be hired out to a third party will be taken out of the $200 budget, and should be avoided to keep this project more practical for those same Makerspaces.
