h1. Shepard Test Stand Design Review v1.1

*There was no formal review of the v1.1 design since it was a minor incremental upgrade.*

* There are some design review items, as well as lessons learned about the Mach 30 design process "here":https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Mf90mKULMSQIIxagVz8EoLMosPMmceKSIxPGebP4vyo .

* There is some DAQ design review information "here":https://opendesignengine.net/boards/4/topics/255 on the forums.

* A design issue that was brought up about the drawer slide used is "here":https://opendesignengine.net/boards/4/topics/247. It was later confirmed that this was actually a problem that surfaces after repeated motor firings.

* A couple of areas where the DAQ system fell short of the requirements was brought up in the last post by Jeremy Wright "here":https://opendesignengine.net/boards/4/topics/159.

This is a newer document based on "this one":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Design_Review_v1_0 , and you should refer to that original version if you want to see the revision history.
