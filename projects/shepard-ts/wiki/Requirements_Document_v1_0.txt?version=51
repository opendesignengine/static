This requirements document is currently being discussed on the forums "here":https://opendesignengine.net/boards/4/topics/72.  The requirements list matches up to the Initial Questions in step one of the Systems Engineering process as shown below. Each requirement is labeled with STSR (Shepard Test Stand Requirement), followed by the number of the "initial question":https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Initial_Questions_v1_0 that the requirement corresponds to, followed by a dot and then the ID number of the requirement.

* *STSR 4.6* Thermocouple requirements
** *STSR 4.6.1* IAW NAR testing manual requirements specified in Section 8.6, the STS shall use thermocouples with "a low thermal mass, and including the amplifier and readout system still be accurate to 10 degrees C" "1":http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf
** *STSR 4.6.2* IAW NAR testing manual requirements specified in Section 8.6, the STS shall use thermocouples with a thermal response of "5 seconds or less" "1":http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf
** *STSR 4.6.3* IAW (partial) NAR testing manual requirements specified in Section 8.6, a thermocouple will be attached to the motor under test "where the propellant and nozzle meet". "1":http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf Full compliance with this requirement has been moved to the future requirements section below.
* *STSR 4.7* IAW NAR testing manual requirements specified in Section 8.5, the STS shall "store the collected data into a general use data formats [sic], such as a .txt, .csv" "1":http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf

h3. Project Requirements

Project requirements are the remaining requirements which are not tied to specific performance values.

* *STSR 2.1* The STS must be well documented so as to meet the needs of open source spaceflight designers who will design and build future test stands (at Mach 30 and elsewhere).
* *STSR 2.2* The STS documentation and procedures must be complete enough that Mach 30 operators, students and educators who want to bring rocket engineering into the classroom, and anyone else interested in how rockets are tested can learn how to use it.
* *STSR 2.3* The STS documentation must cover the engine testing procedure from test stand setup, to running tests, and ending with stowing the test stand.

* *STSR 3.4* The STS shall be operated IAW the safety procedures which are outlined in Section 8 of the NAR testing manual.

* *STSR 4.3* The STS shall provide a fixed base on which to test model rocket motors.

** *STSR 4.3.2* The test stand components will not experience undo vibration during motor firings. 

* *STSR 7.1* All STS design documentation must be open and complete enough so that ANYONE, without necessarily a technical education in rocketry, propulsion, or engineering, would be able to build and operate the test stand.

* *STSR 8.1* The design of the STS must enable the completion of at least one operational test stand.
* *STSR 8.2* Whenever and wherever possible, considerations should be made so that the design of this STS can be used as a kit in the future.

* *STSR 9.1* The cost of the first operational STS must not exceed $200 excluding "consumables" and tools.

* *STSR 10.1* If at all possible, the STS should be completed within 3 months of formal launch as an exercise in agile design.

* *STSR 11.1* Disposal of the spent Estes motors should conform to all local, state, and federal guidelines.
* *STSR 11.2* Electronic waste items, including batteries and circuit boards, must also be disposed of according to all local, state, and federal guidelines.
* *STSR 11.3* If the frame of the STS is damaged beyond repair during operation, proper disposal/recycling guidelines must be followed for the materials used in its construction.
* *STSR 11.4* Wherever possible, the STS design should make it as easy as possible to replace components which are consumable or relatively easy to damage.

h3. Future V2.0 Requirements

These are for reference only so that future features can be accommodated in the current design where practical.

Version 2.0:
* *STSR 5.1* High and low speed video capture of the tests from multiple angles.
* *STSR 5.2* Integrated ignition system so the test management software can control the entire test.
* *STSR 5.3* Additional measurements including:
** *STSR 5.3.1* The STS must meet the second part of the NAR testing manual requirement for casing temperature measurements and have a second thermocouple "3/4 of the way down the motor casing as measured from the nozzle end." "1":http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf
** *STSR 5.3.2* The STS must be able to record exhaust temperature vs time of Estes motors and transport that data to a laptop computer.
* *STSR 5.4* Higher resolution measurements.

Beyond Version 2.0 (Accommodation of):
* *STSR 5.5* High power commercial solid motors.
* *STSR 5.6* Small hybrid motors (on the thrust scale of high power commercial solid motors).
* *STSR 5.7* Larger thrust hybrid motors.
* *STSR 5.8* Small liquid engines.
* *STSR 5.9* Medium liquid engines.
* *STSR 5.10* Large liquid engines.
