h3. Project Requirements

Project requirements are the remaining requirements which are not tied to specific performance values.

* *STSR 2.3* The STS documentation must cover the engine testing procedure from test stand setup, to running tests, and ending with stowing the test stand.

* *STSR 3.3* The STS must be designed in a way that the structure can be slid down over a heavier object, such as a concrete block, to hold it in place. Whoever builds the test stand structure should not be required to permanently fasten it down to an object to keep it stationary.

** *STSR 4.3.2* The test stand components will not experience undo vibration during motor firings. 

* *STSR 7.1* All STS design documentation must be open and complete enough so that ANYONE, without necessarily a technical education in rocketry, propulsion, or engineering, would be able to build and operate the test stand.

* *STSR 8.1* The design of the STS must enable the completion of at least one operational test stand.
* *STSR 8.2* Whenever and wherever possible, considerations should be made so that the design of this STS can be used as a kit in the future.

* *STSR 9.1* The cost of the first operational STS must not exceed $200 excluding "consumables" and tools.

* *STSR 10.1* If at all possible, the STS should be completed within 3 months of formal launch as an exercise in agile design.

* *STSR 11.1* Disposal of the spent Estes motors should conform to all local, state, and federal guidelines.
* *STSR 11.2* Electronic waste items, including batteries and circuit boards, must also be disposed of according to all local, state, and federal guidelines.
* *STSR 11.3* If the frame of the STS is damaged beyond repair during operation, proper disposal/recycling guidelines must be followed for the materials used in its construction.
* *STSR 11.4* Wherever possible, the STS design should make it as easy as possible to replace components which are consumable or relatively easy to damage.

h3. Future Requirements

These are for reference only so that future features can be accommodated in the current design where practical.

* *STSR 5.1* High and low speed video capture of test firings from multiple angles.
* *STSR 5.2* Integrated ignition system so the test management software can control the entire test.
* *STSR 5.3* Additional measurements including:
** *STSR 5.3.1* The STS must meet the second part of the NAR testing manual requirement for casing temperature measurements and have a second temperature sensor "3/4 of the way down the motor casing as measured from the nozzle end." "1":http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf
** *STSR 5.3.2* The STS must be able to record exhaust temperature vs time of Estes motors and transport that data to an attached computer.
* *STSR 5.4* Higher resolution measurements.
* *STSR 5.5* Collection of accelerometer data.

The accommodation of:
