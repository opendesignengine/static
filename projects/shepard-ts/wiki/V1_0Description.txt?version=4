h4. v1.0 Shepard Test Stand - Prototype

This version of the test stand is a prototype to not only teach us about the fundamentals of building a rocket motor test stand, but also about the process of building spaceflight related hardware with a geographically distributed team. Many lessons were learned in this version that will be rolled into future versions of Shepard and beyond.
