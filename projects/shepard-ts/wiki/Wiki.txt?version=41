h2. Introduction

Welcome to the project Wiki for the Mach 30 *Shepard Test Stand*. This test stand holds small model rocket motors in place during firings so that things like thrust and casing temperature can be measured. This wiki contains documentation covering the design, development, fabrication, and use of the test stand.

The *Shepard Test Stand* is named after "Alan Shepard":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard, America's first astronaut, as it is our first test stand. We are using an Arduino board to provide the physical interface between the data collecting computer and the required sensors. This project is the first in a series of projects to develop the required skills for the practice of safe rocket engine operation, and to develop the capability to measure and record data about a rocket engine's performance. The idea behind the *Shepard Test Stand* project is to start small and simple, and then build on what is learned when moving to larger and more complex stands later on. This is very much in keeping with Mach 30's philosophy of starting (literally) from the ground up to build the infrastructure required to facilitate safe, routine, reliable, and sustained access to space. The second iteration of Shepard only measured the thrust and motor casing temperature of Estes model rocket motors sized A through E. This third iteration (v2.0) will step beyond that to offer higher resolution measurements and an easier to assemble structure, among other things. The Shepard project is structured in a way that should allow anyone to build and improve upon the designs. Everyone from experienced space flight hardware designers to educators and students are encouraged to get involved with the project and share their knowledge and enthusiasm.

h2. Shepard for Teachers and Scout Leaders

We are currently working with our partner, the "Coca-Cola Space Science Center":http://www.ccssc.org to develop curriculum so that Shepard can be used in middle school, high school and college classrooms. Along with this, we intend to have Shepard kits available for sale sometime in early 2014. If you're interested in finding out more about Shepard in education, please contact "Mach 30":http://mach30.org/contact .
