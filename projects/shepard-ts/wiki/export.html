	<h5>Notes</h5>


	<ul>
	<li>Be sure to cut out the parts listed in CutList tab of the <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf_files/18" class="external">BOM</a></li>
		<li>The assembly process for the Mechanical System requires the ues of two different glues
	<ul>
	<li>Wood Glue: <a href="http://www.titebond.com/product.aspx?id=2ef3e95d-48d2-43bc-8e1b-217a38930fa2" class="external">Titebond II Premium Wood Glue</a> - This glue forms tight bonds and dries very quickly.  It should be used for all assembly steps except initial fin placement.  It is particularly well suited to making fillets.  Note, transfer this glue to small squeeze bottle for improved application.</li>
		<li>Multi-Surface Glue: <a href="http://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/pg_go2_glue/overview/Go2-Glue.htm" class="external">Loctite Go2 Glue</a> - This glue bonds to a variety of surfaces including metal, used to attach the copper t-connector to the card board Motor Mount</li>

<h4 >Motor Mount<a href="export.html#Motor-Mount" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<p>Assembly of the motor mount follows the instructions supplied with the <strong>Estes D &#38; E Engine Mount Kit</strong> with a few small exceptions which are required to accomodate the t-connector (MM06) used to vent the ejection charge.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Take the mount tube (MM01) and mark one end as the front [where the motor will be inserted] and the other as the rear [where the t-connector (MM06) will be attached]</li>
		<li>Test fit the t-connector (MM06) in the mount tube (MM01) by inserting it approximately 1/4" into the mount tube (MM01) and then remove it; the fit will be tight, and may even require a slight stretching of the mount tube (MM01)</li>
		<li>Make a mark 1/4" from one end of the red engine block (MM04)</li>
		<li>Cut the red engine block (MM04) at the 1/4" line from the previous step, keeping the larger section as the final engine block (see Figure 2)<br /> <strong>Figure 2 - Modified Engine Block (top) vs Original Engine Block (bottom)</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/296" alt="" /></li>
		<li>Follow Step 1 in the <strong>Estes D &#38; E Engine Mount Kit</strong> instructions
	<ol>
	<li>Step 1.A - Make a mark on the mount tube (MM01) 1" from the rear, and make another mark 5/8" from the front [this second mark should be offset along the circumference of the mount tube (MM01) slightly]</li>
		<li>Step 1.B - Cut a 1/8" wide slit at the mark 1" from the rear of the mount tube (MM01); insert the engine hook (MM05) into the slit (see Figure 3)<br /> <strong>Figure 3 - Engine hook inserted into mount tube</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/299" alt="" /></li>
		<li>Step 1.C - Apply wood glue to the outside of engine block (MM06) and the inside of the inside of the rear section of the mount tube (MM01) making sure to completely coat the inside of the mount tube (MM01) up to where the engine hook (MM05) is inserted; Slide the engine block (MM06) into the rear of the mount tube (MM01) until it rests agains the engine hook (MM05); be sure to smooth any excess glue in the mount tube (MM01) to create a smooth water tight surface (see Figure 4)<br /> <strong>Figure 4 - Engine block inserted into mount tube</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/300" alt="" /></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
		<li>Follow Step 2 in the <strong>Estes D &#38; E Engine Mount Kit</strong> instructions - Apply a bead of wood glue around the mount tube (MM01) just to the rear of the mark 5/8" from the front and then slide the engine retainer ring (MM02) onto the the mount tube (MM01) from the front of the mount tube (MM01) until the engine retainer ring (MM02) is just past the 5/8" mark (see Figure 5)<br /> <strong>Figure 5 - Engine retainer ring mounted</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/301" alt="" /> </li>
		<li>Allow the assembly to dry overnight</li>
		<li>Apply a bead of multi-surface glue to the edge of the  base end of the t-connector (MM06)</li>
		<li>Insert the t-connector (MM06) into the rear of the mount tube (MM01) (see Figure 6)<br /> <strong>Figure 6 - Completed motor mount</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/298" alt="" />  </li>
		<li>Allow the motor mount to dry over night</li>

	<a name="Data-Acquisition-DAQ-System"></a>
<h3 >Data Acquisition (DAQ) System<a href="export.html#Data-Acquisition-DAQ-System" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


The assembly of the DAQ system consists of three main sub-assemblies:
	<ol>
	<li>MAX31855 Thermocouple Amplifier Breakout Board</li>
		<li>Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) cable system</li>
		<li>Arduino ProtoShield</li>
	</ol>


	<a name="MAX31855-Thermocouple-Amplifier-Breakout-Board"></a>
<h4 >MAX31855 Thermocouple Amplifier Breakout Board<a href="export.html#MAX31855-Thermocouple-Amplifier-Breakout-Board" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<ul>
	<li>The only assembly required for the MAX31855 breakout board is to solder the header pins and terminal block onto the board. Once this is done the breakout board can be soldered to the Arduino Protoshield.</li>
	</ul>


	<a name="Force-Sensing-Resistor-FSR-cable-system"></a>
<h4 >Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) cable system<a href="export.html#Force-Sensing-Resistor-FSR-cable-system" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<ul>
	<li>The FSR came with male pins, which complicated assembly somewhat. It would be simpler to buy the version of the FSR with a female connector and make your cable fit that configuration. As it was, female D-SUB connectors that were on hand were used to connect the FSR to the CAT 5e cable that was used between the FSR and the ProtoShield. The pins were crimped on to two of the leads of the CAT 5e cable so that the female ends could receive the male pins of the FSR. The reason crimping was used instead of soldering for the pins is that it's very easy to melt the FSR's substrate, thus making the FSR useless, or at least severely altering its operation.</li>
	</ul>


	<a name="Arduino-ProtoShield"></a>
<h4 >Arduino ProtoShield<a href="export.html#Arduino-ProtoShield" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<p>Components were soldered onto the ProtoShield in the configuration shown in the images below. Note that in the bottom view, the ProtoShield has been flipped vertically towards the bottom of the picture. This allows you to orient yourself so that you can follow the traces. For higher resolution images to aid in assembly, check the Shepard_v1.0_DAQ_Assembly_Images.zip file <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf/shepard-ts?folder_id=24" class="external">here</a></p>


	<p><strong>Figure 20 - Top View of the ProtoShield</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/302" alt="" /></p>


	<ol>
	<li>The MAX 31855 breakout board has the correct header pin spacing to fit the holes on the ProtoShield, so it was inserted directly. Note that the capacitor that is included with the K type thermocouple when purchased is being used. The thermocouple's reading had too much noise in it otherwise.</li>
		<li>The red and green wires used were <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103801" class="external">breadboard prototyping jumpers</a> from Radio Shack. Left over Ethernet cable wires can be used as well.</li>
		<li>The resistor was soldered directly to the ProtoShield, but care should be taken that the leads of the resistor do not short any of the connections on the board.</li>
		<li>A 14 pin DIP socket was used for the TLV2374 for multiple reasons including prevention of overheating of the IC during soldering, and ease of replacement in the event of damage due to a wiring mistake.</li>
		<li>A smaller screw terminal block for the FSR leads (left side) would have ideal, but the larger block pictured was all that was available at the time of assembly. The pins are spaced more widely on the block and thus the positioning was dictated by the spacing of the holes on the ProtoShield.</li>
		<li>Notice that even though the two green jumper wires disappear under the MAX 31855 breakout board in the image, they have been labeled with what pins they go from/to.</li>
	</ol>

	<li>If you view the high resolution version of this image from the Shepard_v1.0_DAQ_Assembly_Images.zip file <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf/shepard-ts?folder_id=24" class="external">here</a> , you'll notice that several solder bridges have been made to connect different points. Use the schematic diagram found in the Shepard_v1.0_DAQ.zip file <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf/shepard-ts?folder_id=17" class="external">here</a> to give you a more complete view of what's being bridged.</li>
		<li>The solder bridges are made by laying short lengths of stripped solid wire against the pins (or in the holes) and then soldering them.</li>

	<h5>Notes</h5>


	<ul>
	<li>Be sure to cut out the parts listed in CutList tab of the <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf_files/18" class="external">BOM</a></li>
		<li>The assembly process for the Mechanical System requires the ues of two different glues
	<ul>
	<li>Wood Glue: <a href="http://www.titebond.com/product.aspx?id=2ef3e95d-48d2-43bc-8e1b-217a38930fa2" class="external">Titebond II Premium Wood Glue</a> - This glue forms tight bonds and dries very quickly.  It should be used for all assembly steps except initial fin placement.  It is particularly well suited to making fillets.  Note, transfer this glue to small squeeze bottle for improved application.</li>
		<li>Multi-Surface Glue: <a href="http://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/pg_go2_glue/overview/Go2-Glue.htm" class="external">Loctite Go2 Glue</a> - This glue bonds to a variety of surfaces including metal, used to attach the copper t-connector to the card board Motor Mount</li>

<h4 >Motor Mount<a href="export.html#Motor-Mount" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<p>Assembly of the motor mount follows the instructions supplied with the <strong>Estes D &#38; E Engine Mount Kit</strong> with a few small exceptions which are required to accomodate the t-connector (MM06) used to vent the ejection charge.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Take the mount tube (MM01) and mark one end as the front [where the motor will be inserted] and the other as the rear [where the t-connector (MM06) will be attached]</li>
		<li>Test fit the t-connector (MM06) in the mount tube (MM01) by inserting it approximately 1/4" into the mount tube (MM01) and then remove it; the fit will be tight, and may even require a slight stretching of the mount tube (MM01)</li>
		<li>Make a mark 1/4" from one end of the red engine block (MM04)</li>
		<li>Cut the red engine block (MM04) at the 1/4" line from the previous step, keeping the larger section as the final engine block (see Figure 2)<br /> <strong>Figure 2 - Modified Engine Block (top) vs Original Engine Block (bottom)</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/243" alt="" /></li>
		<li>Follow Step 1 in the <strong>Estes D &#38; E Engine Mount Kit</strong> instructions
	<ol>
	<li>Step 1.A - Make a mark on the mount tube (MM01) 1" from the rear, and make another mark 5/8" from the front [this second mark should be offset along the circumference of the mount tube (MM01) slightly]</li>
		<li>Step 1.B - Cut a 1/8" wide slit at the mark 1" from the rear of the mount tube (MM01); insert the engine hook (MM05) into the slit (see Figure 3)<br /> <strong>Figure 3 - Engine hook inserted into mount tube</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/244" alt="" /></li>
		<li>Step 1.C - Apply wood glue to the outside of engine block (MM06) and the inside of the inside of the rear section of the mount tube (MM01) making sure to completely coat the inside of the mount tube (MM01) up to where the engine hook (MM05) is inserted; Slide the engine block (MM06) into the rear of the mount tube (MM01) until it rests agains the engine hook (MM05); be sure to smooth any excess glue in the mount tube (MM01) to create a smooth water tight surface (see Figure 4)<br /> <strong>Figure 4 - Engine block inserted into mount tube</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/245" alt="" /></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
		<li>Follow Step 2 in the <strong>Estes D &#38; E Engine Mount Kit</strong> instructions - Apply a bead of wood glue around the mount tube (MM01) just to the rear of the mark 5/8" from the front and then slide the engine retainer ring (MM02) onto the the mount tube (MM01) from the front of the mount tube (MM01) until the engine retainer ring (MM02) is just past the 5/8" mark (see Figure 5)<br /> <strong>Figure 5 - Engine retainer ring mounted</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/246" alt="" /> </li>
		<li>Allow the assembly to dry overnight</li>
		<li>Apply a bead of multi-surface glue to the edge of the  base end of the t-connector (MM06)</li>
		<li>Insert the t-connector (MM06) into the rear of the mount tube (MM01) (see Figure 6)<br /> <strong>Figure 6 - Completed motor mount</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/247" alt="" />  </li>
		<li>Allow the motor mount to dry over night</li>

	<p>This completes the Mechanical System assembly process.</p>


	<a name="Data-Acquisition-DAQ-System"></a>
<h3 >Data Acquisition (DAQ) System<a href="export.html#Data-Acquisition-DAQ-System" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


The assembly of the DAQ system consists of three main sub-assemblies:
	<ol>
	<li>MAX31855 Thermocouple Amplifier Breakout Board</li>
		<li>Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) cable system</li>
		<li>Arduino ProtoShield</li>
	</ol>


	<a name="MAX31855-Thermocouple-Amplifier-Breakout-Board"></a>
<h4 >MAX31855 Thermocouple Amplifier Breakout Board<a href="export.html#MAX31855-Thermocouple-Amplifier-Breakout-Board" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<ul>
	<li>The only assembly required for the MAX31855 breakout board is to solder the header pins and terminal block onto the board. Once this is done the breakout board can be soldered to the Arduino Protoshield.</li>
	</ul>


	<a name="Force-Sensing-Resistor-FSR-cable-system"></a>
<h4 >Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) cable system<a href="export.html#Force-Sensing-Resistor-FSR-cable-system" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<ul>
	<li>The FSR came with male pins, which complicated assembly somewhat. It would be simpler to buy the version of the FSR with a female connector and make your cable fit that configuration. As it was, female D-SUB connectors that were on hand were used to connect the FSR to the CAT 5e cable that was used between the FSR and the ProtoShield. The pins were crimped on to two of the leads of the CAT 5e cable so that the female ends could receive the male pins of the FSR. The reason crimping was used instead of soldering for the pins is that it's very easy to melt the FSR's substrate, thus making the FSR useless, or at least severely altering its operation.</li>
	</ul>


	<a name="Arduino-ProtoShield"></a>
<h4 >Arduino ProtoShield<a href="export.html#Arduino-ProtoShield" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>


	<p>Components were soldered onto the ProtoShield in the configuration shown in the images below. Note that in the bottom view, the ProtoShield has been flipped vertically towards the bottom of the picture. This allows you to orient yourself so that you can follow the traces. For higher resolution images to aid in assembly, check the Shepard_v1.0_DAQ_Assembly_Images.zip file <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf/shepard-ts?folder_id=24" class="external">here</a></p>


	<p><strong>Figure 20 - Top View of the ProtoShield</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/203" alt="" /></p>


	<ol>
	<li>The MAX 31855 breakout board has the correct header pin spacing to fit the holes on the ProtoShield, so it was inserted directly. Note that the capacitor that is included with the K type thermocouple when purchased is being used. The thermocouple's reading had too much noise in it otherwise.</li>
		<li>The red and green wires used were <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103801" class="external">breadboard prototyping jumpers</a> from Radio Shack. Left over Ethernet cable wires can be used as well.</li>
		<li>The resistor was soldered directly to the ProtoShield, but care should be taken that the leads of the resistor do not short any of the connections on the board.</li>
		<li>A 14 pin DIP socket was used for the TLV2374 for multiple reasons including prevention of overheating of the IC during soldering, and ease of replacement in the event of damage due to a wiring mistake.</li>
		<li>A smaller screw terminal block for the FSR leads (left side) would have ideal, but the larger block pictured was all that was available at the time of assembly. The pins are spaced more widely on the block and thus the positioning was dictated by the spacing of the holes on the ProtoShield.</li>
		<li>Notice that even though the two green jumper wires disappear under the MAX 31855 breakout board in the image, they have been labeled with what pins they go from/to.</li>
	</ol>

	<li>If you view the high resolution version of this image from the Shepard_v1.0_DAQ_Assembly_Images.zip file <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf/shepard-ts?folder_id=24" class="external">here</a> , you'll notice that several solder bridges have been made to connect different points. Use the schematic diagram found in the Shepard_v1.0_DAQ.zip file <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/dmsf/shepard-ts?folder_id=17" class="external">here</a> to give you a more complete view of what's being bridged.</li>
		<li>The solder bridges are made by laying short lengths of stripped solid wire against the pins (or in the holes) and then soldering them.</li>

<h3 >Overview<a href="export.html#Overview" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p>The budget is $200, firm. If there is a conflict between function and budget, for this iteration, budget should trump. Our goal is not to make the perfect test stand, it is to upgrade the first prototype (v1.0) of the test stand in a way that gives us an upgrade path to v2.0 and beyond. In the process we will continue to learn both about test stands, and about our processes within our distributed design framework. Holding to a firm budget minimizes the amount of time spent trying to make the stand perfect (once you are out of money, you have to wrap up the project, successful or not). Even an "unsuccessful" prototype will teach us important lessons to apply moving forward. This budget does not include "consumables" such as motors, nor tools, but the $200 cost for the stand itself keeps the basic project affordable if standard tools found in Makerspaces can be used. Any manufacturing that has to be hired out to a third party will be taken out of the $200 budget, and should be avoided to keep this project more practical for those same Makerspaces.</p>

	<p>The budget is $200, firm. If there is a conflict between function and budget, for this iteration, budget should trump. Our goal is not to make the perfect test stand, it is to make the first prototype of a test stand and see what we can learn from that experience (both about test stands, and about our processes). We can always go back and do another iteration to meet the design requirements if needed. Holding to a firm budget minimizes the amount of time spent trying to make it perfect (once you are out of money, you have to wrap up the project, successful or not). Even a "unsuccessful" prototype will teach us important lessons to apply moving forward. This budget does not include "consumables" such as motors, nor tools, but the $200 cost for the stand itself keeps the basic project affordable if standard tools found in hackerspaces can be used. Any manufacturing that has to be hired out to a third party will be taken out of the $200 budget, and should be avoided to keep this project more practical for those same hackerspaces.</p>

	<p>The Shepard Test Stand design is broken down into two main components. The first is the mechanical system, and the second is the Data Acquisition (DAQ) system. The mechanical system consists of the frame of the test stand, as well as the motor mounting mechanism and mounts for the thrust and temperature sensors. The DAQ system handles the task of collecting the data from the sensors and presenting them to the user in a way that facilitates motor testing.</p>

	<p>The Shepard Test Stand v1.0 mechanical system (pictured above) is made up of six key components.  They are:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>Test Stand Base</strong> - The <strong>Test Stand Base</strong> (<strong>Base</strong>) is constructed from ripped down 2x10 pine stock, and fits over a 4" x 8" x 16" (nominal) solid concrete block which is available at most hardware stores.  The outer dimensions of the <strong>Base</strong> are 10-7/8" x 21-1/2" x 5-3/16", and its inner dimensions are 7-3/4" x 15-5/8" x 3-1/2".  The key dimensions of the base are the inner dimensions (to allow the base to fit over the concrete block during operation) and an open platform of 20" in length to accommodate the <strong>Test Section Beam</strong>.</li>
		<li><strong>Back Plate</strong> - The <strong>Back Plate</strong> is constructed from ripped down 2x10 pine stock.  Its function is to provide resistance to the thrust, and a mounting location for the force sensor (on the side facing the motor) and the DAQ electronics (on the side opposite the force sensor).  The dimensions of the <strong>Back Plate</strong> are 7-3/4" x 14" x 1-1/2" (with 8-13/16" sticking up above the base).  The key dimensions are the width (to match the top of the <strong>Base</strong>) and the height (which should be no less than 8" to provide enough space to mount the force sensor and the electronics).  Note, there may be one or more holes in the <strong>Back Plate</strong> to feed wires from the sensors to the DAQ board (or other purposes).  In the current version, there is one 3/8" diameter hole drilled through the center of the <strong>Back Plate</strong> approximately 3-7/8" above the <strong>Base</strong> to allow a cord from the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> to facilitate calibration.  After passing through the <strong>Back Plate</strong> the cord goes over a pulley mounted on the back side of the <strong>Back Plate</strong> so weights can be hung from the cord to simulate thrust applying force to the force sensor.</li>
		<li><strong>Test Section Beam</strong> - The <strong>Test Section Beam</strong> (<strong>Beam</strong>) is constructed from a 2x4 pine board, and sits vertically on top of the <strong>Base</strong>, along the center line.  It is 20" long (6" longer than the <strong>Rail System</strong>) to provide room for the <strong>Rail System</strong> to retract the <strong>Motor Mount</strong> and <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> away from the <strong>Back Plate</strong> for maintenance.  The key dimension is its length.</li>
		<li><strong>Rail System</strong> - The <strong>Rail System</strong> restricts the motor under test to motion along the initial thrust vector.  It is made from a <a href="http://www.libertyhardware.com/search/detail/?searchType=retail&#38;ID=D80614C-ZP-W&#38;FIN=ZP" class="external"><strong>Liberty</strong> 14 inch Ball Bearing Drawer Slide</a> (PN D80614C-ZP-W, available at <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/buy/liberty-14-in-ball-bearing-full-extension-drawer-slide-d80614c-zp-w.html#.UEAZVNaPWsg" class="external">Home Depot</a>).  Note, this was the shortest ball bearing drawer guide available at the time of testing.  If a shorter drawer guide is found, the overall length of the test stand could be reduced.  It is installed along the top of the <strong>Beam</strong> along the <strong>Beam's</strong> center line.</li>
		<li><strong>Rail Shield</strong> (not shown) - Testing of v1.0 showed the <strong>Rail System</strong> was prone to becoming fouled by the exhaust from the motor under test.  To protect the <strong>Rail System</strong>, a sheet metal guard, or <strong>Rail Shield</strong>, was added to the v1.1 design.  The <strong>Rail Shield</strong> is a folded sheet piece of sheet metal sized and shaped to completely cover the portion of the <strong>Rail System</strong> in front of the <strong>Motor Mount</strong>.  It is attached to the test stand with screws (for a small <strong>Rail Shield</strong>, it is attached to the <strong>Rail System</strong>; for a large <strong>Rail Shield</strong>, like the one used by CCSSC, it is attached to the <strong>Test Stand Base</strong>).</li>
		<li><strong>Motor Mount</strong> -  The <strong>Motor Mount</strong> is based on an <a href="http://www.estesrockets.com/rockets/accessories/engine-mounting/303159-d-and-e-engine-mount-kit" class="external">Estes D and E Engine Mount Kit</a> (PN 303159).  It is assembled according to the instructions for E size motors with four modifications.
	<ol>
	<li>It is assembled without "Centering Rings" (the cardboard rings used to connect the mount to a rocket body)</li>
		<li>1/4" is removed from the "Engine Block" to leave room for a 3/4" copper plumbing t-connector to be inserted into the aft end of the mount</li>
		<li>A layer of wood glue is spread on the inside of the motor mount at the aft end to seal the surface which will be glued to the t-connector</li>
		<li>A 3/4" copper t-connector is glued into the aft end of the motor mount to redirect the ejection charge</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
		<li><strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> - The <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> provides a connection between the <strong>Motor Mount</strong> and the <strong>Rail System</strong>.  It is a 1/2" thick plate with a block on the aft end sized to provide the correct contact area with the force sensor.  The current version is constructed from 1/2" sheet of pine plywood (to create the plate) and a pine block cut from a 2x4.  The plate's dimensions are 6-1/4" x 1-23/32" x 1/2" (the 1-23/32" dimension is set to fit the selected force sensor).  The block is 1-1/2" x 1-7/32" x 1-23/32".  The critical dimensions are the overall length of the plate (sufficient to accommodate the block and the <strong>Motor Mount</strong>) and the area presented at the back of the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> (sized for the force sensor).  The <strong>Motor Mount</strong> is attached to the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> using 2 plastic zip ties (rated at least 50 lbf), one over the t-connector and the other over the "Engine Retainer Ring" at the front of the <strong>Motor Mount</strong>.  The <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> has a number of holes drilled into it.  Two countersunk holes are used to attach the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> to the <strong>Rail System</strong>.  Four straight-through holes are used to allow the zip ties to pass through the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong>.  Finally, two grooves are cut in the bottom of the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> to give the zip ties room between the <strong>Rail System</strong> and the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong>.  Many of these details can be seen in the image below.</li>

	<p>The Shepard Test Stand v1.0 Data Acquisition (DAQ) system (pictured above) is made up of four key components.  They are:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>Arduino Uno</strong> - The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno" class="external">Arduino Uno</a> is an open hardware electronics prototyping platform that serves as the base for the test stand's DAQ system.</li>
		<li><strong>Arduino Proto Shield</strong> - The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoProtoShield" class="external">Arduino Proto Shield</a> is a pre-built shield for the Arduino Uno that allows a developer to easily package their components for the platform. There is a general overview of the components on the test stand's proto shield below.</li>
		<li><strong>Force Sensing Resistor (FSR)</strong> - The <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/productdocs/2010-10-26-DataSheet-FSR406-Layout2.pdf" class="external">FSR</a> is a variable resistor who's resistance changes as pressure is applied to its contact area. These resistors are very low cost, but have issues with accuracy and drift, among others. For this prototype which used an FSR with male connectors, a custom cable was made using CAT 5 Ethernet cable and D-SUB pins to connect the FSR to the Arduino Uno. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: The FSR that was selected had an effective measurement range from 0.1 to 10 Newtons, which was too low for the rocket motors being tested since some could generate a peak thrust of nearly 30 Newtons. This was an oversight that ended up being a moot point because of the FSRs other shortcomings.</li>
		<li><strong>Type K Thermocouple</strong> - The <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/270" class="external">thermocouple</a> has a 1-meter long fiberglass braided cable and can read temperatures of up to 500 °C.</li>
	</ol>


	<p><img src="../../../attachments/download/229" alt="" /></p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>MAX31855 Thermocouple Amplifier Breakout Board</strong> - Available from Adafruit Industries, this <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/MAX31855.pdf" class="external">amplifier</a> is designed to work with any K-type themocouple and gives output from -200 °C to 1350 °C in 0.25 °C increments. It uses a SPI data interface with a built-in 14-bit ADC, and requires 70 to 100 ms to do a conversion. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: This slow conversion time seems to be the biggest factor limiting our overall data collection sample rate to around 15 samples/sec.</li>
		<li><strong>0.01uF Capacitor</strong> - This capacitor is wired in parallel with the thermocouple and helps smooth out the sampling jitter in noisy environments.</li>
		<li><strong>560 Ohm Resistor</strong> - This resistor is one side of a voltage divider, with the FSR being the other. This allows us to convert the change in resistance of the FSR to a voltage so that it can be measured by the Arduino Uno.</li>
		<li><strong>TLV2374IN Quad 3MHz Op Amp</strong> - This TLV2374 is in a DIP package to make it easier to prototype. This IC is used to amplify the voltage from the FSR to a level suitable for the analog inputs of the Arduino Uno.</li>
		<li><strong>14 Pin IC Socket</strong> - Lying beneath the TLV2374, this is used to make it possible to swap out TLV2374 ICs if one is damaged in prototyping, and also prevents heat from the soldering iron from being transferred directly into the IC during assembly.</li>

	<p>The Shepard Test Stand design is broken down into two main components. The first is the mechanical system, and the second is the Data Acquisition (DAQ) system. The mechanical system consists of the frame of the test stand, as well as the motor mounting mechanism and mounts for the thrust and temperature sensors. The DAQ system handles the task of collecting the data from the sensors and presenting them to the user in a way that facilitates motor testing.</p>

	<p>The Shepard Test Stand v1.0 mechanical system (pictured above) is made up of six key components.  They are:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>Test Stand Base</strong> - The <strong>Test Stand Base</strong> (<strong>Base</strong>) is constructed from ripped down 2x10 pine stock, and fits over a 4" x 8" x 16" (nominal) solid concrete block which is available at most hardware stores.  The outer dimensions of the <strong>Base</strong> are 10-7/8" x 21-1/2" x 5-3/16", and its inner dimensions are 7-3/4" x 15-5/8" x 3-1/2".  The key dimensions of the base are the inner dimensions (to allow the base to fit over the concrete block during operation) and an open platform of 20" in length to accommodate the <strong>Test Section Beam</strong>.</li>
		<li><strong>Back Plate</strong> - The <strong>Back Plate</strong> is constructed from ripped down 2x10 pine stock.  Its function is to provide resistance to the thrust, and a mounting location for the force sensor (on the side facing the motor) and the DAQ electronics (on the side opposite the force sensor).  The dimensions of the <strong>Back Plate</strong> are 7-3/4" x 14" x 1-1/2" (with 8-13/16" sticking up above the base).  The key dimensions are the width (to match the top of the <strong>Base</strong>) and the height (which should be no less than 8" to provide enough space to mount the force sensor and the electronics).  Note, there may be one or more holes in the <strong>Back Plate</strong> to feed wires from the sensors to the DAQ board (or other purposes).  In the current version, there is one 3/8" diameter hole drilled through the center of the <strong>Back Plate</strong> approximately 3-7/8" above the <strong>Base</strong> to allow a cord from the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> to facilitate calibration.  After passing through the <strong>Back Plate</strong> the cord goes over a pulley mounted on the back side of the <strong>Back Plate</strong> so weights can be hung from the cord to simulate thrust applying force to the force sensor.</li>
		<li><strong>Test Section Beam</strong> - The <strong>Test Section Beam</strong> (<strong>Beam</strong>) is constructed from a 2x4 pine board, and sits vertically on top of the <strong>Base</strong>, along the center line.  It is 20" long (6" longer than the <strong>Rail System</strong>) to provide room for the <strong>Rail System</strong> to retract the <strong>Motor Mount</strong> and <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> away from the <strong>Back Plate</strong> for maintenance.  The key dimension is its length.</li>
		<li><strong>Rail System</strong> - The <strong>Rail System</strong> restricts the motor under test to motion along the initial thrust vector.  It is made from a <a href="http://www.libertyhardware.com/search/detail/?searchType=retail&#38;ID=D80614C-ZP-W&#38;FIN=ZP" class="external"><strong>Liberty</strong> 14 inch Ball Bearing Drawer Slide</a> (PN D80614C-ZP-W, available at <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/buy/liberty-14-in-ball-bearing-full-extension-drawer-slide-d80614c-zp-w.html#.UEAZVNaPWsg" class="external">Home Depot</a>).  Note, this was the shortest ball bearing drawer guide available at the time of testing.  If a shorter drawer guide is found, the overall length of the test stand could be reduced.  It is installed along the top of the <strong>Beam</strong> along the <strong>Beam's</strong> center line.</li>
		<li><strong>Motor Mount</strong> -  The <strong>Motor Mount</strong> is based on an <a href="http://www.estesrockets.com/rockets/accessories/engine-mounting/303159-d-and-e-engine-mount-kit" class="external">Estes D and E Engine Mount Kit</a> (PN 303159).  It is assembled according to the instructions for E size motors with four modifications.
	<ol>
	<li>It is assembled without "Centering Rings" (the cardboard rings used to connect the mount to a rocket body)</li>
		<li>1/4" is removed from the "Engine Block" to leave room for a 3/4" copper plumbing t-connector to be inserted into the aft end of the mount</li>
		<li>A layer of wood glue is spread on the inside of the motor mount at the aft end to seal the surface which will be glued to the t-connector</li>
		<li>A 3/4" copper t-connector is glued into the aft end of the motor mount to redirect the ejection charge</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
		<li><strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> - The <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> provides a connection between the <strong>Motor Mount</strong> and the <strong>Rail System</strong>.  It is a 1/2" thick plate with a block on the aft end sized to provide the correct contact area with the force sensor.  The current version is constructed from 1/2" sheet of pine plywood (to create the plate) and a pine block cut from a 2x4.  The plate's dimensions are 6-1/4" x 1-23/32" x 1/2" (the 1-23/32" dimension is set to fit the selected force sensor).  The block is 1-1/2" x 1-7/32" x 1-23/32".  The critical dimensions are the overall length of the plate (sufficient to accommodate the block and the <strong>Motor Mount</strong>) and the area presented at the back of the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> (sized for the force sensor).  The <strong>Motor Mount</strong> is attached to the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> using 2 plastic zip ties (rated at least 50 lbf), one over the t-connector and the other over the "Engine Retainer Ring" at the front of the <strong>Motor Mount</strong>.  The <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> has a number of holes drilled into it.  Two countersunk holes are used to attach the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> to the <strong>Rail System</strong>.  Four straight-through holes are used to allow the zip ties to pass through the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong>.  Finally, two grooves are cut in the bottom of the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong> to give the zip ties room between the <strong>Rail System</strong> and the <strong>Motor Mount Bracket</strong>.  Many of these details can be seen in the image below.</li>

	<p>The Shepard Test Stand v1.0 Data Acquisition (DAQ) system (pictured above) is made up of four key components.  They are:</p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>Arduino Uno</strong> - The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno" class="external">Arduino Uno</a> is an open hardware electronics prototyping platform that serves as the base for the test stand's DAQ system.</li>
		<li><strong>Arduino Proto Shield</strong> - The <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoProtoShield" class="external">Arduino Proto Shield</a> is a pre-built shield for the Arduino Uno that allows a developer to easily package their components for the platform. There is a general overview of the components on the test stand's proto shield below.</li>
		<li><strong>Force Sensing Resistor (FSR)</strong> - The <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/productdocs/2010-10-26-DataSheet-FSR406-Layout2.pdf" class="external">FSR</a> is a variable resistor who's resistance changes as pressure is applied to its contact area. These resistors are very low cost, but have issues with accuracy and drift, among others. For this prototype which used an FSR with male connectors, a custom cable was made using CAT 5 Ethernet cable and D-SUB pins to connect the FSR to the Arduino Uno. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: The FSR that was selected had an effective measurement range from 0.1 to 10 Newtons, which was too low for the rocket motors being tested since some could generate a peak thrust of nearly 30 Newtons. This was an oversight that ended up being a moot point because of the FSRs other shortcomings.</li>
		<li><strong>Type K Thermocouple</strong> - The <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/270" class="external">thermocouple</a> has a 1-meter long fiberglass braided cable and can read temperatures of up to 500 °C.</li>
	</ol>


	<p><img src="../../../attachments/download/152" alt="" /></p>


	<ol>
	<li><strong>MAX31855 Thermocouple Amplifier Breakout Board</strong> - Available from Adafruit Industries, this <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/MAX31855.pdf" class="external">amplifier</a> is designed to work with any K-type themocouple and gives output from -200 °C to 1350 °C in 0.25 °C increments. It uses a SPI data interface with a built-in 14-bit ADC, and requires 70 to 100 ms to do a conversion. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: This slow conversion time seems to be the biggest factor limiting our overall data collection sample rate to around 15 samples/sec.</li>
		<li><strong>0.01uF Capacitor</strong> - This capacitor is wired in parallel with the thermocouple and helps smooth out the sampling jitter in noisy environments.</li>
		<li><strong>560 Ohm Resistor</strong> - This resistor is one side of a voltage divider, with the FSR being the other. This allows us to convert the change in resistance of the FSR to a voltage so that it can be measured by the Arduino Uno.</li>
		<li><strong>TLV2374IN Quad 3MHz Op Amp</strong> - This TLV2374 is in a DIP package to make it easier to prototype. This IC is used to amplify the voltage from the FSR to a level suitable for the analog inputs of the Arduino Uno.</li>
		<li><strong>14 Pin IC Socket</strong> - Lying beneath the TLV2374, this is used to make it possible to swap out TLV2374 ICs if one is damaged in prototyping, and also prevents heat from the soldering iron from being transferred directly into the IC during assembly.</li>

	<p>There are the problems that have been discovered with the current design.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>It has been mentioned that the cut list has some errors in cut lengths, but the incorrect cuts were not documented. However, these errors cause the cuts to be too long, so no material will be wasted during the build process.</li>
		<li>The data acquisition (DAQ) system is not capable of sample rates in excess of 15 samples per second. This is due to the fact that the thermocouple amplifier requires 70 to 100 milliseconds to do a temperature conversion (A to D). This is an unacceptably slow sample rate. The target for future iterations up through version 2.x should be a minimum of 200 samples per second.</li>
		<li>The contact between the Force Sensing Resistor's (FSR's) backing plate and the motor mount's contact plate is not completely parallel. This causes skewed results with the FSR.</li>
		<li>There was a process breakdown among the Shepard team that caused some Shepard v2.0 DAQ features to be mixed into the development logs and wiki for v1.1. The documentation has been cleaned up, but may still contain some v2.0 contamination that was missed.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>There are a four main problems with the current design that will need to be addressed in future iterations (v1.1+).</p>


	<ol>
	<li>The drawer guide that is being used as a linear guide is not properly shielded from motor exhaust particulates, and thus the guide's bearings tend to foul after less than 30 test firings.</li>
		<li>The data acquisition system is not capable of sample rates in excess of 15 samples per second. This is due to the fact that the thermocouple amplifier requires 70 to 100 milliseconds to do a temperature conversion (A to D). This is an unacceptably slow sample rate. The target for future iterations up to version 2.0 should be a minimum of 150 samples per second.</li>
		<li>The Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) used will not measure forces in excess of 10.0 Newtons. Some of the motors that this stand tests can exert a trust of 25 to 30 Newtons, so this is unacceptable because the full range of thrust cannot be measured. </li>
		<li>The contact between the FSR's backing plate and the motor mount's contact plate was not completely parallel in version 1.0. This causes skewed results with the FSR. This should be corrected in future 1.x versions as much as the material (wood) allows.</li>

	<p><strong>A1</strong>. <em>The Shepard Test Stand is the first step toward developing an open source test stand for flight capable rocket engines. It's focus on low power, commercially available amateur rocket motors is intended to provide a safe first experience for both designers (low power and low cost lead to little penalty for failing to meet design goals the first time around) and operators (low power leads to lower cost if accidentally misused during early training). Additionally, as one of Mach 30's earliest open source hardware projects, it will give us practical experience in open source hardware development and managing projects on Open Design Engine (ODE). Finally, we have received interest in performing live demonstrations of the test stand as part of educational and outreach activities, so it is expected the test stand will become an educational and marketing tool.</em></p>

<h3 >Q2. Who is this for?<a href="export.html#Q2-Who-is-this-for" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h3>


	<p><strong>A2.</strong> <em>The Shepard Test Stand is for anyone wanting to learn about measuring the performance of rocket motors. This includes open source spaceflight designers who will design and build future test stands (at Mach 30 or elsewhere), Mach 30 operators who will use future test stands in other Mach 30 projects, students and educators who want to bring rocket engineering into the classroom, and anyone else interested in how rockets are tested. To ensure the Shepard Test Stand will be accessible to the entire user community, including users with no experience in spacecraft engineering, the Shepard Test Stand team has selected a representative user with limited experience in spacecraft engineering and testing hardware. This representative user is a middle school (6th through 8th grade in the U.S.) teacher who does not have the support of an IT department, and who does not have computer expertise beyond how to connect a USB cable and install software, but has the desire to introduce their students to rocket science in a safe and hands-on way.</em></p>

<strong>A4.</strong> The test stand needs to:
	<ul>
	<li><em>Provide a stable base on which to test model rocket motors.</em></li>
		<li><em>Accommodate Estes rocket motor sizes A through E.</em></li>
		<li><em>Provide the ability to measure motor thrust while keeping an accurate timestamp for each data point.</em></li>
		<li><em>Provide the ability to measure motor case temperature or flame temperature while keeping an accurage timestamp for each data point.</em></li>
		<li><em>Allow for the thermal sensor to be moved so it can either measure case temperature or flame temperature. Note, when measuring the case temperature the DAQ will need to collect data for longer than the thrust duration to capture the temperature change in the case after the motor finishes firing.</em></li>
		<li><em>Keep cleanup and maintenance to a minimum between consecutive test firings.</em></li>
		<li><em>Have a motor mount which will survive motor failure or be relatively easy to replace in the event of a motor failure.</em></li>
		<li><em>Be easily set up and torn down for demonstration purposes. Specifically, the setup and tear down procedures should be tool-less, or at a maximum require simple tools such as screwdriver and/or hammer rather than something like a masonry drill bit.</em></li>
		<li><em>Be easy to package for shipment to any event at which it will be used. Be particularly aware of dimensions and weight and how they impact shipping costs. Note, CCSSC intends to use up to 10 test stands at a time, so transportation considerations should also take into account transporting multiple test stands.</em></li>
		<li><em>Conform to the <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Requirements_Document" class="external">safety requirements</a> as outlined in section 8.3 of the <a href="http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf" class="external">NAR Standards &#38; Testing Committee Motor Testing Manual Version 1.5</a> .</em></li>
		<li><em>Be "hackable" so users and makers are encouraged to experiment with the design of the test stand.</em></li>
		<li><em>Provide space for labels to be added for safety warnings, branding, etc.</em></li>
		<li><em>Have desktop control software that will run on all three major PC platforms (MS Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux).</em></li>
		<li><em>Include a DAQ system that uses standard connections back to the control software (for example, USB, Ethernet, or similar connections).</em></li>

	<ol>
	<li><em>The structure should easily mount to a concrete block without the need for special tools or modifying the block.</em></li>

	<p><strong>A8.</strong> <em>Previous efforts focused on developing the single initial prototype.  The success of this prototype and the very strong interest in the use of the Shepard Test Stand in schools (middle school through college) has led Mach 30 to decide it will sell Shepard Test Stand kits for use in schools, scouting troupes, and makerspaces. This means developing the Shepard Test Stand into a finished product.  So, the short answer to this question is "as many as the market demands."</em></p>

	<p><strong>A9.</strong> <em>Based on feedback form CCSSC, the final cost for Shepard Test Stand kits needs to be around $200 (though having a data component and being reusable like Shepard could allow for higher prices). Using the standard OSHW cost multiplier of 2.6, the total cost for parts and labor needs to be around $78 (note, the most recent experiments in structure design have a materials cost of about $40). To allow for several additional prototypes while still holding the materials cost down, the updated structure budget has a threshhold (maximum value) of $150 and an objective of $100.</em></p>

	<p><strong>A11.</strong> Spent Estes motors will be a waste product of the operation of this test stand, and any residual materials should be treated as hazardous. Disposal of these motors should conform to all local, state, and federal guidelines. Estes motors are based on black powder propellant, so any motors that do not fire properly or are damaged can be disposed of in an ordinary manner by first soaking them in water until the casing unwraps and the propellant falls apart. Possible electronic waste items may include batteries from the ignition control box, and circuit boards. These must also be disposed of according to all local, state, and federal guidelines. If the frame of the test stand is damaged beyond repair during operation, proper disposal/recycling guidelines must be followed for the materials used in its construction.</p>

	<p>This document has been relinked to the Initial Questions document <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Initial_Questions" class="external">here</a> as part of our versioning system update.</p>


	<p>Below is a list of questions and proposed answers to help us narrow down the requirements for this project. You can view the original forum discussion <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/boards/4/topics/38" class="external">here</a></p>


	<p><strong>Q1. Why are we making this?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A1</strong>. <em>The Shepard Test Stand is the first step toward developing an open source test stand for flight capable rocket engines. It's focus on low power, commercially available amateur rocket motors is intended to provide a safe first experience for both designers (low power and low cost lead to little penalty for failing to meet design goals the first time around) and operators (low power leads to lower cost if accidentally misused during early training). Additionally, as one of Mach 30's earliest open source hardware projects, it will give us practical experience in open source hardware development and managing projects on ODE. Finally, we have received interest in performing live demonstrations of the test stand as part of educational and outreach activities, so it is expected the test stand will become an educational and marketing tool.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Q2. Who is this for?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A2</strong>. <em>The Shepard Test Stand is for anyone wanting to learn about measuring the performance of rocket motors. This includes open source spaceflight designers who will design and build future test stands (at Mach 30 or elsewhere), Mach 30 operators who will use future test stands in other Mach 30 projects, students and educators who want to bring rocket engineering into the classroom, and anyone else interested in how rockets are tested.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Q3. How will this be used?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A3</strong>. <em>The final test stand will be used for verification of typical motor performance metrics such as thrust and exhaust temperature. These metrics will be compared against benchmark values provided in the <a href="http://estes.aptinet.com/images/page%2033.pdf" class="external">Estes motor documentation</a> . The test stand will also be used to do demonstrations at various conferences and educational events (outdoor only).</em></p>


	<p><strong>Q4. What features does it need to have (now)?</strong></p>


<strong>A4</strong>. <em>The test stand needs to:</em>
	<ul>
	<li><em>Be easily set up and torn down for demonstration purposes.</em></li>
		<li><em>Be easy to package for shipment to any event at which it will be used.</em></li>
		<li><em>Provide a stable base on which to test model rocket motors.</em></li>
		<li><em>Accommodate Estes rocket motor sizes A through E.</em></li>
		<li><em>Provide the ability to measure thrust and exhaust temperature while keeping an accurate timestamp for each data point.</em></li>
		<li><em>Conform to the Shepard Test Stand <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Requirements_Document_v1_0" title="STSR4.x" class="external">safety requirements</a>, which are based on the <a href="http://www.nar.org/SandT/docs/ST-MotorTestingManual.pdf" class="external">NAR Standards &#38; Testing Committee Motor Testing Manual Version 1.5</a> .</em></li>
	</ul>


	<p><strong>Q5. What features does it need to have (later)?</strong></p>


<strong>A5a.</strong> Version 2.0
	<ul>
	<li>High and low speed video capture of the tests from multiple angles.</li>
		<li>Integrated ignition system so the test management software can control the entire test.</li>
		<li>Additional measurements.</li>
		<li>Higher resolution measurements.</li>
	</ul>


<strong>A5b.</strong> Beyond Version 2.0
	<ul>
	<li>High power commercial solid motors.</li>
		<li>Small hybrid motors (on the thrust scale of high power commercial solid motors).</li>
		<li>Larger thrust hybrid motors.</li>
		<li>Small liquid engines.</li>
		<li>Medium liquid engines.</li>
		<li>Large liquid engines.</li>
	</ul>


	<p><strong>Q6. What are the legacy requirements?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A6</strong>. <em>This is the first project of its kind at Mach 30, there are no existing projects it must interface with. However, if the system includes desktop control software, that software should run on all three major PC platforms (MS Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux). Additionally, it should use standard connections back to the control software (for example, USB, Ethernet, or similar connections).</em></p>


	<p><strong>Q7. Who's going to build this?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A7</strong>. <em>It is assumed that volunteers within the Mach 30 community will build this test stand. The designs will be open so that ANYONE, without necessarily a technical education in rocketry, propulsion, or engineering, would be able to build and operate a Shepard test stand.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Q8. How many do we want to make?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A8</strong>. <em>One (for now). If the design proves particularly valuable as a teaching or training tool, we may revisit this decision. If highly successful, it is not outside the realm of possibility to consider offering it (or a related design) as a kit for others to assemble.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Q9. What is the budget?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A9.</strong> $200, firm. If there is a conflict between function and budget, for this iteration, budget should trump. Our goal is not to make the perfect test stand, it is to make the first prototype of a test stand and see what we can learn from that experience (both about test stands, and about our processes). We can always go back and do another iteration to meet the design requirements if needed. Holding to a firm budget minimizes the amount of time spent trying to make it perfect (once you are out of money, you have to wrap up the project, successful or not). Even a "unsuccessful" prototype will teach us important lessons to apply moving forward. This budget does not include "consumables" such as motors, nor tools, but the $200 cost for the stand itself keeps the basic project affordable if standard tools found in hackerspaces can be used. Any manufacturing that has to be hired out to a third party will be taken out of the $200 budget, and should be avoided to keep this project more practical for those same hackerspaces.</p>


	<p><strong>Q10. What is the timeline?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A10</strong>. <em>The goal is to complete the project within three months of formal launch as an exercise of agile design. However, given the project is also an experiment in open source hardware development and is all volunteer based, we need to recognize the need to be flexible in this requirement.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Q11. What waste products will be produced by the manufacture and/or operation of this?</strong></p>


	<p><strong>A11.</strong> Spent Estes motors will be a waste product of the operation of this test stand, and any residual materials should be treated as hazardous. Disposal of these motors should conform to all local, state, and federal guidelines. Estes motors are based on black powder propellant, so any motors that do not fire properly or are damaged can be disposed of in an ordinary manner by first soaking them in water until the casing unwraps and the propellant falls apart. Possible electronic waste items may include batteries from the ignition control box, and circuit boards. These must also be disposed of according to all local, state, and federal guidelines. If the frame of the test stand is damaged beyond repair during operation, proper disposal/recycling guidelines must be followed for the materials used in its construction.</p>

	<p><strong>There were no formal integration tests for version 1.1, but the information for version 1.0's tests is below.</strong></p>

	<p>The software at this point was very rudimentary, and did little more than tell us the test stand had the potential to give data similar to the published Estes thrust curves. It was at this point that it was realized that a contact pad needed to be created for the interface between the motor mount block and the Force Sensing Resistor (FSR). This ensured that there was contact across the entire face of the FSR without contacting the border area. This is a requirement of the FSR to make sure that you get valid readings. The FSR and the contact pad were affixed to the stand with double sided tape that was thin and did not compress under load.</p>

	<p>Inside the <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino</code> directory within the repository (/trunk/ShepardDCS/ShepardDCS_Arduino), you will find the <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino.ino</code> file. Before this file can be opened and run using the Arduino IDE, there is a third-party library from Adafruit that must be installed for the MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier breakout board. The library should already be included in the <code>trunk/libraries</code> directory, but if it's not, the library can be downloaded from Github <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/MAX6675-library" class="external">here</a> , and instructions to install the library are included under the "Arduino Library" section <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/thermocouple/using-a-thermocouple" class="external">here</a> . To make sure that the library gets inluded, set the <code>shepard-ts/trunk</code> directory to be the <strong>Sketchbook location</strong> under <strong>File -> Preferences</strong> in the Arduino IDE.</p>

	<p>When you've downloaded the source code via subversion, you descend through the directory tree until you end up in the <code>ShepardDCS</code> directory (see <strong>Listing 1</strong>). Inside this directory you will find a directory holding the Arduino code, and one holding the Processing (PC-side) code. There is a file named <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino.ino</code> inside the <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino</code> directory. You open this file with the Arduino IDE and compile/upload it to the Arduino Uno. The <code>ShepardDCS_Processing</code> directory includes the <code>ShepardDCS_Processing.pde</code> file, which you open and run with the Processing IDE on your PC to display the data dashboard for Shepard.</p>

</pre></p>


	<p>You'll notice that there is a <code>libraries</code> directory at the same level as the <code>ShepardDCS</code> directory. <code>libraries</code> contains the ControlP5 library which provides the graphical elements for the ShepardDCS user interface. In order for this library to be found, you will either need to move the <code>libraries</code> directory into the already configured Processing sketchbook directory, or you'll have to reconfigure the sketchbook directory to point to the <code>trunk</code> directory.

	<p>Once you're connected the PC to the Arduino Uno with a USB cable, open and run the <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino.ino</code> file from the Arduino IDE first. This will load and start the program on the Uno. When the Arduino program is running and ready to transmit data, the TX LED for the serial port will be lighted continuously.</p>


	<p>Start the Processing application and the TX LED on the Arduino Uno should start to flash. If you have the sensors attached, you should be able to apply pressure to the thrust sensor to change the "CUR" (current thrust value) slide on the user interface as a simple test. To check temperature monitoring, you can hold the thermocouple between your thumb and index finger to see if the "CUR" value for the temperature rises.</p>


	<p>There are several components of the user interface, and those are numbered for reference in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.</p>

	<ol>
	<li>The <strong>SERIAL PORT</strong> dropdown box allows you to set the serial port that the Arduino is attached to. This dropdown box will be populated with the serial ports (including the Arduino) that are attached to your system. For Windows it will be a serial port designation such as "COM5", and for Linux it will be something like <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> . Linux users may have to add themselves to a group that has access to serial ports such as <code>dialout</code>.</li>
		<li>The text that you enter in the <strong>MOTOR MODEL</strong> field will be prepended to the output file name. The rest of the file name will consist of a time stamp. For instance, if you enter "B1-6" in the <strong>MOTOR MODEL</strong> text field and then record data at 8:42:38 AM, you will end up with a file name of <strong>B1-6_8_42_32.csv</strong>. If you leave this field blank the file name will start with an underscore followed by the time stamp (<strong>_8_42_32.csv</strong>).</li>
		<li>The <strong>ENABLE RECORDING</strong> button allows you to control whether or not the application keeps track of the thrust and temperature on the chart, and the max/peak and average sliders. This button also controls whether or not the data is written to a CSV file. When this button is enabled (clicked so that it becomes highlighted) and the thrust value goes above a value of 0.0, data will be collected. Once the <strong>ENABLE RECORDING</strong> button is disabled (clicked so that it is no longer highlighted) and the thrust value has been above 0.0, the data will be written to a file.</li>
		<li>The <strong>CLEAR</strong> button clears the charts, averages, and maxes to prepare for the next run. Do not click this until you are finished looking at the data from the previous test.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Thrust</strong> chart has Newtons (N) on the Y-axis, and time on the X-axis. The X-axis will auto scale as the time (seconds) increases, and new values feed from the right side to the left side of the chart.</li>
		<li>The <strong>CUR</strong> (current value) sliders provide a graphical and numeric representation of either the thrust (top slider), or the temperature (bottom slider). The slider will fill from the bottom to the top as the value increases.</li>
		<li>The <strong>PEAK</strong> or <strong>MAX</strong> value sliders show the same thing, but different terminology is used for the thrust (<strong>PEAK</strong>) than for the temperature (<strong>MAX</strong>). Both of these sliders show the highest value that is reached during a test run. This is either the peak thrust of the motor, or the highest temperature that was seen on the motor casing.</li>
		<li>The <strong>AVG</strong> (average) sliders keep track of a running average of the values reported by the thrust and temperature sensors. This average is influenced by how long you leave the <strong>ENABLE RECORDING</strong> button enabled (clicked so that it is highlighted), so it's best to stop the recording soon after the motor has exhausted its fuel and ejected the parachute charge.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Temperature</strong> chart works in the same way as the <strong>Thrust</strong> chart above. The Y-axis is in degrees Celsius (C), and the X-axis is again in seconds. The X-axis auto-scales as time increases, and new values feed from the right side of the chart to the left.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>For a normal test run, you would follow all of the steps shown in "Hardware Operation" above. Two software related items that are called out is clicking the <strong>Enable Recording</strong> button and clicking the <strong>Clear</strong> button. If the <strong>Enable Recording</strong> button is not clicked when you preform a test run, you will only see the current value slider change, and no data will be recorded. On the other hand, you do not want the <strong>Enable Recording</strong> button to be clicked/enabled when you're testing sensors or you may end up with a false trigger and useless data. Keep the <strong>Enable Recording</strong> button toggled to disabled until you're ready to perform a test fire. Failure to click the <strong>Clear</strong> button before doing another test run will cause the new data to be combined with the old data, causing tandem curves on the charts, and incorrect averages and maxes.</p>


	<p>The test stand's data is stored in CSV (comma delimited) format, so you can copy the files to any computer to perform an analysis. Applications like Microsoft Office and Libre Office will allow you to create line charts and do much more with the data.</p>

	<p>Once the third-party library is installed, you should be able to compile and upload the Arduino program. You can then close the Arduino IDE, restart the Arduino Uno, and launch the Processing app to start collecting the data.</p>

	<p>Inside the <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino</code> directory within the repository (/trunk/ShepardDCS/ShepardDCS_Arduino), you will find the <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino.ino</code> file. Before this file can be opened and run using the Arduino IDE, there is a third-party library from Adafruit that must be installed for the MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier breakout board. The library should already be included in the <code>trunk/libraries</code> directory, but if it's not, the library can be downloaded from Github <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/MAX6675-library" class="external">here</a> , and instructions to install the library are included under the "Arduino Library" section <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/thermocouple/using-a-thermocouple" class="external">here</a> . To make sure that the library gets inluded, set the <code>shepard-ts/trunk</code> directory to be the <strong>Sketchbook location</strong> under <strong>File -> Preferences</strong> in the Arduino IDE.</p>

	<p>When you've downloaded the source code via subversion, you descend through the directory tree until you end up in the <code>ShepardDCS</code> directory (see <strong>Listing 1</strong>). Inside this directory you will find a directory holding the Arduino code, and one holding the Processing (PC-side) code. There is a file named <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino.ino</code> inside the <code>ShepardDCS_Arduino</code> directory. You open this file with the Arduino IDE and compile/upload it to the Arduino Uno. The <code>ShepardDCS_Processing</code> directory includes the <code>ShepardDCS_Processing.pde</code> file, which you open and run with the Processing IDE on your PC to display the data dashboard for Shepard.</p>

</pre></p>


	<p>You'll notice that there is a <code>libraries</code> directory at the same level as the <code>ShepardDCS</code> directory. <code>libraries</code> contains the ControlP5 library which provides the graphical elements for the ShepardDCS user interface. In order for this library to be found, you will either need to move the <code>libraries</code> directory into the already configured Processing sketchbook directory, or you'll have to reconfigure the sketchbook directory to point to the <code>trunk</code> directory. This option is found under File -> Preferences in the Processing IDE (<strong>Figure 1</strong> and <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p>

	<p>In order to download the latest source code for the data acquisition (DAQ) software, you will need a subversion client.</p>


	<p><strong>Please be aware that the newest versions of Shepard DCS will not work with this version of the Shepard DAQ. You'll want to check out <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/repository/revisions/22" class="external">version 22</a> instead.</strong></p>


	<p>On Linux, you can install the subversion package and then execute the following on a command line.</p>


<pre>
svn co https://opendesignengine.net/svn/shepard-ts
</pre>

	<p>This will download the source tree to the current directory. The top level directory will be <code>shepard-ts</code> and the most current version will be in the <code>trunk</code> directory.</p>

	<p><strong>There was no formal testing done on version 1.1. However, work was done to ensure that the replacement Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) increased the effective range of the thrust measurement.</strong></p>


The testing was done in three main phases, with the first two progressing in parallel:
	<ol>
	<li>The mechanical system was tested as a stand-alone unit.</li>
		<li>The Data Acquisition (DAQ) system was tested as a stand-alone unit.</li>
		<li>The mechanical and DAQ systems were integrated and then tested.</li>

	<p>During DAQ System testing, it was discovered that the data collection rate of the system was much too low, being around 15 samples per second. This is due to the fact that the MAX31855 thermocouple amplifier takes between 70 and 100 milliseconds to convert its reading.</p>


	<a name="Integrated-Testing"></a>
<h2 >Integrated Testing<a href="export.html#Integrated-Testing" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h2>


	<p>During the integrated testing, 2 more flaws were discovered in the design.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>The drawer guide used as the linear rail for the motor mount tended to foul within 30 to 50 test firings due to the fact the ball bearings were exposed to the motor exhaust particulates. Figure 1 shows the fouling.</li>
		<li>The Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) that was specified for the test stand was not capable of registering anything higher than 10 Newtons of force. This puts some of the higher thrust motors beyond the range that the FSR can measure.</li>
	</ol>


	<p><strong>Figure 1 - Fouling of the Drawer Guide's Bearings By Exhaust Particulates</strong><br /><img src="../../../attachments/download/232" alt="" /></p>


	<p>It was also realized before the first test firing that the motor mount contact pad would have to be added. This was to ensure that the thrust of the motor was spread over the entire sensing surface of the FSR and not beyond into the substrate border.</p>

<h1 >V1.1 Description<a href="export.html#V11-Description" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h1>


	<p>The second iteration of the Shepard rocket motor test stand. This is an incremental update over 1.0 where only the major issues are fixed, and the requirements are scaled back appropriately for the level of the project.</p>


	<p>There was a little bit of a process breakdown on this version, so some version 2.0 DAQ documentation got mixed in with the version 1.1 docs. Because of this, the wiki and dev logs may be a little hard to follow but have been cleaned up as much as possible.</p>


	<p>Please refer instead to the Shepard v2.0 documentation to make sure that you are building the latest iteration.</p>

	<p>Welcome to the project Wiki for the Mach 30 <strong>Shepard Test Stand</strong>. This test stand holds small model rocket motors fixed (clamped in place) during firings so that things like thrust and casing temperature can be measured. This wiki contains documentation covering the design, development, fabrication, and use of the test stand.</p>


	<p>The <strong>Shepard Test Stand</strong> is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard" class="external">Alan Shepard</a>, America's first astronaut, as it is our first test stand. We are using an Arduino board to provide the physical interface between the data collecting computer and the required sensors. This project is the first in a series of projects to develop the required skills for the practice of safe rocket engine operation, and to develop the capability to measure and record data about a rocket engine's performance. The idea behind the <strong>Shepard Test Stand</strong> project is to start small and simple, and then build on what is learned when moving to larger and more complex stands later on. This is very much in keeping with Mach 30's philosophy of starting (literally) from the ground up to build the infrastructure required to facilitate safe, routine, reliable, and sustained access to space. The second iteration of Shepard only measured the thrust and motor casing temperature of Estes model rocket motors sized A through E. This third iteration (v2.0) will step beyond that to offer higher resolution measurements and an easier to assemble structure, among other things. The Shepard project is structured in a way that should allow anyone to build and improve upon the designs. Everyone from experienced space flight hardware designers to educators and students are encouraged to get involved with the project and share their knowledge and enthusiasm.</p>


	<p>If you're interested in getting involved, please introduce yourself in the forums and let us know what your interests and specialties are. There is also the navigation bar at the right to help you browse the documentation to get up-to-speed.</p>

	<p>We are currently working with a partner organization, the <a href="http://www.ccssc.org" class="external">Coca-Cola Space Science Center</a> to develop curriculum so that Shepard can be used in middle school, high school, and college classrooms. In addition, we intend to have Shepard Test Stand kits available for sale sometime in the first half of 2014. If you're interested in finding out more about Shepard in education, please contact <a href="http://mach30.org/contact" class="external">Mach 30</a> . If you're planning to build and operate a Shepard Test Stand on your own, please start by reading the <a href="https://opendesignengine.net/projects/shepard-ts/wiki/Safety_Procedures" class="external">Safety Procedures.</a></p>
